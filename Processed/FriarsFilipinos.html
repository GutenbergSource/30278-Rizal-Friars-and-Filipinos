<p class="first">While serving on the staff of the first United States
Commission to the Philippine Islands my attention was called to the
life and writings of Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal. I found in his novel,
&ldquo;Noli Me Tangere,&rdquo; the best picture of the life of the
people of those islands under Spanish rule, and the clearest exposition
of the governmental problems which Spain failed to solve, and with
which our own people must deal. It occurred to me that an English
translation of Rizal&rsquo;s work would be of great value at the
present time. My first intention was to reproduce the entire novel as
it was written, but, after careful consideration, I thought best to
abridge the story by the omission of some parts which did not seem
essential to the main purpose of the work. The present volume is the
result.</p>
<p>Readers should not understand any of Rizal&rsquo;s references to
priests and friars as reflections upon the Roman Catholic Church. He
was throughout his life an ardent Catholic, and died a firm adherent of
the Church. But he objected to the religious orders in the Philippine
Islands, because he knew well that they were more zealous in furthering
their own selfish ends than in seeking the advancement of Christianity.
From experience, Dr. Rizal knew that the friars, under cloak of the
gospel ministry, oppressed his fellow countrymen, and took advantage of
their superstition and ignorance. These wrongs he was brave enough to
expose in his writings. In the friars he saw an obstacle to the
education and enlightenment of the Filipino people, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e163" href="#xd21e163" name=
"xd21e163">vi</a>]</span>and, using moderate means, he did his utmost
to secure reform. His writings will explain to us the cause of the
hatred shown by the Filipinos toward the religious corporations, and
will make clearer the nature of one of the present problems in the
Philippines.</p>
<p>There are in the Philippines five religious orders: the Dominicans,
Franciscans, Recoletos, Augustines and Jesuits. According to John
Foreman, an eminent authority, the members of all of these, except the
last named, come from the lower classes in Spain, and are on the whole
comparatively ignorant and uncultured. Under the Spanish system of
government certain provinces were assigned to each of the
orders&mdash;except the Jesuits&mdash;and the friars were distributed
among the different parishes. In the town assigned to him the friar had
much authority. He was chief adviser in all civil affairs, and, by his
influence over the superstitious natives, maintained absolute control
in all matters pertaining to the local government as well as to the
local church. So firm was his hold that he led the Spanish government
to believe that the islands could not be ruled without his aid. Knowing
that his power rested on the ignorance of the people he discouraged
education among them. When native Filipinos advanced so far as to prove
an obstacle to the religious orders, as did Rizal and many others, the
friars sought to destroy them. Forgetting their holy mission, the
religious orders became commercial corporations, amassed enormous
wealth, and gained possession of the most valuable parts of the
islands, though to much of this property the titles are not clear.</p>
<p>From my own observation, and from information derived from the
Spaniards themselves, I am convinced that the author has not overdrawn
his pictures. In fact I have learned of instances where the oppression
and practices of the friars were even worse than those described. Dr.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e169" href="#xd21e169" name=
"xd21e169">vii</a>]</span>Rizal has given us a portrayal of the
Filipino character from the viewpoint of the most advanced Filipino. He
brings out many facts that are pertinent to present-day questions,
showing especially the Malayan ideas of vengeance, which will put great
difficulties in the way of the pacifying of the islands by our forces.
The reader will not fail to notice the striking similarity between the
life of Ibarra, the hero, and that of Rizal, the author, a short sketch
of whose career has been given in the following pages.</p>
<p>For assistance in preparing this volume for publication I offer
sincere thanks to William H. Glasson, Ph.D., Instructor in History in
the George School, Newtown, Pa. Dr. Glasson has read the entire
manuscript and proofs, and I have been glad to avail myself of his
advice on many doubtful points. I desire also to acknowledge my
indebtedness for favors received to Horatio Green, Interpreter to the
Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, to W. G. Richardson, of New
York, and to the publishers.</p>

<h2 class="main">Jos&eacute; Rizal.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal, of whose &ldquo;Noli Me
Tangere,&rdquo; the following story, is an abridgement, is the most
striking character to be found in the history of the Philippine
Islands. He was not only a great martyr to the cause of liberty, and to
the advancement of his fellow men, but he was without doubt the
greatest Filipino ever born, and his memory is cherished to-day by his
people as we ourselves cherish the memory of Washington.</p>
<p>Rizal was born on June 19th, 1861, in the pueblo of Calamba, in the
province of Laguna, on the Island of Luzon. He came of a Tagalog
family, which, it is said, acknowledged a slight mixture of Chinese
blood, and possessed considerable property. As a child he gave evidence
of extraordinary precocity. He is said to have written poetry in his
native tongue at eight years of age, produced a successful melodrama at
fourteen, and later to have won prizes in literary contests with
writers of recognized ability.</p>
<p>After passing through the University of Manila, and receiving much
instruction at the hands of the Jesuit fathers, he was sent to Europe
to complete his education. He pursued courses of study in Spanish and
German universities, and won the degrees of Doctor of Medicine and
Doctor of Philosophy. Besides acquiring a knowledge of seven languages
he gained a brilliant reputation for proficiency in the branch of
optical surgery. For a time he was the leading assistant in the office
of a world-renowned specialist at Vienna.</p>
<p>While in Europe Rizal wrote several books and also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e581" href="#xd21e581" name=
"xd21e581">xiv</a>]</span>gave considerable time to sculpture and
painting. His artistic ability was great, and some of his productions
are now treasured by friends into whose possession they came.
Rizal&rsquo;s best known work is his &ldquo;Noli Me Tangere,&rdquo;
written in Belgium about 1886 or 1887. This novel, with its vivid
picture of life in the Philippines, and its exposure of Spanish misrule
and oppression, won for him the bitter hatred of the friars, and
inspired the relentless persecution which only ended with the taking of
his life.</p>
<p>In 1889 Dr. Rizal returned to the Philippines, but was soon
compelled to leave his native land in order to escape forcible
banishment. After a short residence in Japan, he went to London, where
he published a work on the History of the Philippine Islands. About the
same time a sequel to &ldquo;Noli Me Tangere,&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;El
Filibusterismo,&rdquo; was published. The hatred of the priests against
him was further inflamed by this production, and the government in
Manila was forced by the friars to forbid the circulation of any of his
writings. Copies of his novels were burned in the public squares, and
it was worth one&rsquo;s life to be found possessing a copy. Until very
recently it has been almost impossible to obtain a copy of
Rizal&rsquo;s works, and it was necessary to go to Europe to secure the
one from which the following abridged translation was made.</p>
<p>In 1892 Dr. Rizal was so overcome with a desire to see again his
beautiful fatherland that he ventured, in the face of all the dangers
that threatened him, to return to Manila. He had scarcely set foot on
shore, however, before he was arrested and thrown in prison. The friars
demanded his execution on the ground that he carried incendiary
leaflets for the purpose of stirring up a rebellion, but subsequent
inquiries showed that such leaflets <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e587" href="#xd21e587" name="xd21e587">xv</a>]</span>had been
introduced into his baggage at the custom house through the intrigues
of the Augustine friars. Despite his indignant protestations of
innocence; Rizal was summarily condemned by the Spanish General,
Despujols, to banishment at Dapitan in the island of Mindanao. Although
the trickery of the friars became known to him, Despujols lacked
courage to revoke his order of banishment, for fear that he, too, would
incur the hatred of the powerful religious corporations.</p>
<p>After four years of exile Rizal saw plainly that the hostility of
the friars would make it impossible for him to live in his native land.
In 1896 a plague of yellow fever broke out in the island of Cuba and
Rizal volunteered to lend his medical services to the Spanish
government. Ramon Blanco, then general-in-chief of the Spanish forces
in the Philippines, accepted the generous offer and recalled the young
man to Manila that he might sail at once for Cuba. Alarmed by
demonstrations of popular affection for Rizal, who represented the
aspirations of the Filipino people, the Spanish authorities broke faith
with him and imprisoned him in the Fuerza de Santiago. He was arraigned
on false charges, given a military trial, and at the dictation of the
religious orders was sentenced to be shot as a traitor.</p>
<p>At dawn on December 30th, 1896, he was led to the place of execution
on the beautiful Luneta, overlooking the tranquil surface of Manila
Bay. Notices of the event had been published throughout the islands and
the day on which it was to occur was proclaimed a fiesta. Thousands
gathered around the place selected, and so evident was the sympathy of
the helpless Filipinos for the man who was to die for their sake that
Spain marshalled ten regiments of her soldiers about the spot. The
populace must be intimidated. A nation&rsquo;s hero was about to become
a nation&rsquo;s martyr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e593" href=
"#xd21e593" name="xd21e593">xvi</a>]</span>With face uplifted he
glanced at the multitude about him and smiled. They tied his arms
behind him and made him face the waters of the bay. In vain he
protested and begged that he might die facing his executioners. A squad
of his fellow countrymen, who were serving in Spain&rsquo;s army, were
selected for the bloody work. They drew in position to shoot him in the
back. The order was given to fire, but only one had the courage to
obey. The bullet went straight and the hero fell, but another shot was
necessary to despatch his life. His newly wedded wife remained with him
to the end. The best hope of the Filipino people was crushed; a light
in a dark place was snuffed out.</p>
<p>Rizal was no extremist, no believer in harsh and bloody methods, no
revolutionist. He aimed to secure moderate and reasonable reforms, to
lessen the oppressive exactions of the friars, to examine into titles
of their land, and to make possible the education and uplifting of his
people. He loved Spain as he did his own country, and repeatedly used
his influence against the rebellious measures proposed by other
Filipino leaders. His execution was only one of the numerous outrages
which characterized Spain&rsquo;s reign in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In closing this short sketch of Rizal&rsquo;s life we can do no
better than to quote the estimate of him made by Dr. Ferdinand
Blumentritt, professor in the University of Leitmeritz, Austria, who
prepared a biographical sketch of Rizal. Dr. Blumentritt said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Not only is Rizal the most
prominent man of his own people, but the greatest man the Malayan race
has produced. His memory will never perish in his fatherland, and
future generations of Spaniards will yet learn to utter his name with
respect and reverence.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb1" href=

<h2 class="super">Friars and Filipinos.</h2>
<h2 class="label">Chapter I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Don Santiago&rsquo;s Dinner.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the latter part of October, Don Santiago de los
Santos, popularly known as Captain Tiago, gave a dinner. Though,
contrary to his custom, he had not announced it until the afternoon of
the day on which it was to occur, the dinner became at once the
absorbing topic of conversation in Binondo, in the other suburbs of
Manila, and even in the walled city. Captain Tiago was generally
considered a most liberal man, and his house, like his country, shut
its doors to no one, whether bent on pleasure or on the development of
some new and daring scheme.</p>
<p>The dinner was given in the captain&rsquo;s house in Analoague
street. The building is of ordinary size, of the style of architecture
common to the country, and is situated on that arm of the Pasig called
by some Binondo Creek. This, like all the streams in Manila, satisfies
a multitude of needs. It serves for bathing, mortar-mixing, laundering,
fishing, means of transportation and communication, and even for
drinking water, when the Chinese water-carriers find it convenient to
use it for that purpose. Although the most important artery of the
busiest part of the town, where the roar of commerce is loudest and
traffic most congested, the stream is, for a distance of a mile,
crossed by only one wooden bridge. During six months of the year, one
end of this bridge is out of order, and the other end is impassable
during the remaining time.</p>
<p>The house is low and somewhat out of plumb. No one, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>however,
knows whether the faulty lines of the building are due to a defect in
the sight of the architect who constructed it, or whether they are the
result of earthquakes and hurricanes.</p>
<p>A wide staircase, with green balustrades and carpeted here and there
in spots, leads from the <i>zaguan</i>, or tiled entrance hall, to the
second story of the house. On either side of this staircase is a row of
flower-pots and vases, placed upon chinaware pedestals, brilliant in
coloring and fantastic in design. Upstairs, we enter a spacious hall,
which is, in these islands, called <i>caida</i>. This serves to-night
for the dining hall. In the middle of the room is a large table,
profusely and richly ornamented, fairly groaning under the weight of
delicacies.</p>
<p>In direct contrast to these worldly preparations are the motley
colored religious pictures on the walls&mdash;such subjects as
&ldquo;Purgatory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last
Judgment,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of the Just,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Death of the Sinner.&rdquo; Below these, in a beautiful renaissance
frame, is a large, curious linen engraving of two old ladies. The
picture bears the inscription &ldquo;Our Lady of Peace, Propitious to
Travellers, Venerated in Antipolo, Visiting in the Guise of a Beggar
the Pious Wife of the Famous Captain In&eacute;s in Her
Sickness.&rdquo; In the side of the room toward the river, Captain
Tiago has arranged fantastic wooden arches, half Chinese, half
European, through which one can pass to the roof which covers part of
the first story. This roof serves as a veranda, and has been
illuminated with Chinese lanterns in many colors and made into a pretty
little arbor or garden. The <i>sala</i> or principal room of the house,
where the guests assembled is resplendent with colossal mirrors and
brilliant chandeliers, and, upon a platform of pine, is a costly piano
of the finest workmanship.</p>
<p>People almost filled this room, the men keeping on one side and the
women on the other, as though they were in a Catholic church or a
synagogue. Among the women were a number of young girls, both native
and Spanish. Occasionally one of them forgot herself and yawned, but
immediately sought to conceal it by covering her mouth with her fan.
Conversation was carried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>on in a low voice and died away in vague
mono-syllables, like the indistinct noises heard by night in a large
mansion.</p>
<p>An elderly woman with a kindly face, a cousin of Captain Tiago,
received the ladies. She spoke Spanish regardless of all the
grammatical rules, and her courtesies consisted in offering to the
Spanish ladies cigarettes and betel nut (neither of which they use) and
in kissing the hands of the native women after the manner of the
friars. Finally the poor old lady was completely exhausted, and, taking
advantage of a distant crash occasioned by the breaking of a plate,
hurried off precipitately to investigate, murmuring:
&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> Just wait, you
good-for-nothings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the men there was somewhat more animation. In one corner of
the room were some cadets, who chatted with some show of interest, but
in a low voice. From time to time they surveyed the crowd and indicated
to each other different persons, meanwhile laughing more or less
affectedly.</p>
<p>The only people who appeared to be really enjoying themselves were
two friars, two citizens and an officer of the army who formed a group
around a small table, on which were bottles of wine and English
biscuits. The officer was old, tall and sunburnt, and looked as the
Duke of Alva might have looked, had he been reduced to a command in the
civil guard. He said little, but what he did say was short and to the
point. One of the friars was a young Dominican, handsome and dressed
with extreme nicety. He wore gold mounted spectacles and preserved the
extreme gravity of youth. The other friar, however, who was a
Franciscan, talked a great deal and gesticulated even more. Although
his hair was getting gray, he seemed to be well preserved and in robust
health. His splendid figure, keen glance, square jaw and herculean form
gave him the appearance of a Roman patrician in disguise. He was gay
and talked briskly, like one who is not afraid to speak out. Brusque
though his words might be, his merry laugh removed any disagreeable
impression.</p>
<p>As to the citizens, one of them was small in stature <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>and wore a
black beard, his most noticeable feature being his large nose&mdash;so
large that you could scarcely believe that it was all his own. The
other was a young blonde, apparently a recent arrival in the country.
The latter was carrying on a lively discussion with the Franciscan.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; said the
friar, &ldquo;when you have been in the country a few months, and will
be convinced that what I say is right. It is one thing to govern in
Madrid and another to rule in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I, for example,&rdquo; continued
Father D&aacute;maso, raising his voice to prevent the other from
speaking, &ldquo;I, who can point to my twenty-three years of existence
on bananas and rice, can speak with some authority on this subject. Do
not come to me with theories or arguments, for I know the native.
Remember, that when I came to this country, I was sent to a parish,
small and largely devoted to agriculture. I did not understand Tagalog
very well, but I received the confessions of the women and we managed
to understand each other. In fact, they came to think so much of me
that three years afterward, when I was sent to another and larger town,
where a vacancy had been created by the death of the native parish
priest, all the women were in tears. They overwhelmed me with presents,
they saw me off with bands of music&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But this only
shows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wait, wait! Do not be in a hurry!
My successor remained there a still shorter time, but when he left
there were more people to see him off, more tears shed, and more music
played, although he had treated the people worse than I, and had raised
the parish dues to a sum almost double the amount I had
exacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But allow
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Furthermore, I was twenty years in
the town of San Diego and it was only a few months
ago&mdash;that&mdash;that I left. Twenty years! Surely any one will
admit that twenty years is time enough to get acquainted with a town.
There were six thousand people in San Diego, and I knew every one of
them as if he were my own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href=
"#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>child. I knew even the private affairs
of them all; I knew in what way this man was &lsquo;crooked,&rsquo;
where the shoe pinched that one, what slips every girl had made and
with whom, and who was the true father of each child, for I received
all of their confessions and they always confessed scrupulously. I can
prove what I say by Santiago, our host, for he has considerable
property in that town, and it was there that we became friends. Well,
then! This will show you what sort of people the natives are: when I
went away, only a few old women and some lay brothers saw me off. And
that, after I had been there twenty years! Don&rsquo;t you see that
this proves beyond a doubt that all the reforms attempted by the
Ministers of the Government in Madrid are perfectly absurd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now the young man&rsquo;s turn to be perplexed. The
lieutenant, who had been listening to the argument, knit his brows. The
little man with the black beard made ready to combat or support Father
D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s arguments, while the Dominican was content to
remain entirely neutral.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But do you
believe&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; the young man finally asked in a curious
mood, and looking straight at the friar.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do I believe it? As I do the
Gospel! The native is so indolent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! Pardon me for interrupting
you,&rdquo; said the young blonde, lowering his voice and drawing his
chair closer, &ldquo;but you have spoken a word that arouses my
interest. Is this indolence an inherent characteristic of the native,
or is it true, as a foreign traveller has said in speaking of a country
whose inhabitants are of the same race as these, that this indolence is
only a fabrication to excuse our own laziness, our backwardness and the
faults of our celestial system?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! That is nothing but envy! Ask
Se&ntilde;or Laruja, who knows this country very well, whether the
native has his equal in the world for indolence and
ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is a fact,&rdquo; replied the
little man referred to, &ldquo;that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>nowhere in the world can any one be
found more indolent than the native. Positively nowhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor more vicious and
ungrateful!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor with less
education!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat uneasy, the blonde man began to glance about the room.
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;I believe that
we are in the house of a native, and these young ladies
may&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! Don&rsquo;t be so sensitive.
How long have you been in the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Four days,&rdquo; answered the
young man somewhat ruffled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you come here as an
employee?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, sir. I came on my own account
in order to become acquainted with the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Man, what a rare bird you
are!&rdquo; exclaimed Father D&aacute;maso, looking at him with
curiosity. &ldquo;To come here on your own account for such foolish
ends! What a phenomenon! And when so many books have been written about
this country&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, striking the arm of his chair with sudden violence, he
exclaimed: &ldquo;The country is being lost; it is lost already. The
governing power supports heretics against the ministers of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; again
asked the lieutenant, half rising from his chair.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do I mean?&rdquo; repeated
Father D&aacute;maso, again raising his voice, and facing the
lieutenant. &ldquo;I mean what I say. I mean that, when a priest turns
away the corpse of a heretic from his cemetery, no one, not even the
King himself, has the right to interfere, and still less to punish. And
yet a general, a miserable little general&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father! His Excellency is the
vice-regal representative of His Majesty the King!&rdquo; exclaimed the
officer, rising to his feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do I care for His Excellency,
or for any of your vice-regal representatives!&rdquo; answered the
Franciscan, rising in his turn. &ldquo;In any other time than the
present, he would have been thrown down stairs in the same way as the
religious corporations treated the sacrilegious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>governor
Bustamente in his time. Those were the days when there was
faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you right here
that I don&rsquo;t allow any&mdash;His Excellency represents His
Majesty the King!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether he is
king or rogue. For us there is no king other than the
true&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Stop this immediately!&rdquo;
shouted the lieutenant in a threatening manner, and as though he were
commanding his own soldiers. &ldquo;Take back what you have said, or
to-morrow I shall inform His Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go and tell him at once! Go tell
him!&rdquo; answered Father D&aacute;maso, sarcastically, at the same
time approaching the lieutenant with his fists doubled.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think for a moment that, because I wear the
dress of a monk, I&rsquo;m not a man. Hurry! Go tell him! I&rsquo;ll
lend you my carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion began to grow ridiculous as the speakers became more
heated, but, at this point, fortunately, the Dominican interfered.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; he said in a
tone of authority, and with that nasal twang which is so characteristic
of the friars, &ldquo;there is no reason why you should thus confuse
matters or take offense where it is not intended. We should distinguish
between what Father D&aacute;maso says as a man, and what he says as a
priest. Whatever he may say as a priest cannot be offensive, for the
words of a priest are understood to be absolutely true.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But I understand what his motives
are, Father Sibyla!&rdquo; interrupted the lieutenant, who saw that he
would be drawn into a net of such fine distinction that, if he allowed
it to go on, Father D&aacute;maso would get off scot free. &ldquo;I
know very well what his motives are, and Your Reverence will also
perceive them. During the absence of Father D&aacute;maso from San
Diego, his assistant buried the body of a very worthy person. Yes, sir,
an extremely worthy person! I had known the man from time to time and
had often been his guest. What if he never had been to confession? I do
not confess, either. To say that he committed suicide is a lie, a
slander. A man such as he, with a son whose success and love were more
than all the world to him; a man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8"
href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>who believed in God, who fulfilled
his duty to society, who was honorable and just&mdash;such a man does
not commit suicide. That is what I say! I am not telling you all that I
think about this matter, and Your Reverence should be very thankful
that I restrain myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning his back on the Franciscan, he continued: &ldquo;As I was
saying, this priest, when he returned to the town, after maltreating
his coadjutor, ordered that the man&rsquo;s body be taken up and thrown
out of the cemetery, to be buried I know not where. The town of San
Diego was too cowardly to protest, though, in fact, very few people
knew much about the matter. The dead man had no relatives in the town
and his only son was in Europe. His Excellency, however, learned about
the affair, and being at heart upright and just, he ordered that the
priest be punished. As a result, Father D&aacute;maso was transferred
to another but better town. That is all there was to it. Now you can
make all the distinctions you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he left the group.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am very sorry to have touched
upon so delicate a subject,&rdquo; said Father Sibyla, &ldquo;but,
after all, if the change from one town to another was to your
advantage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How could it be to my advantage?
How about all the things that I lost?&rdquo; interrupted Father
D&aacute;maso, fairly boiling over with rage.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Good evening, gentlemen! Good
evening, Father!&rdquo; said Captain Santiago, who at that instant
entered the room, leading a youth by the hand. On saluting his guests
in this manner, he kissed the hands of the priests, who, by the way,
forgot to give him their blessing. The Dominican took off his
gold-rimmed spectacles in order to examine the new arrival at better
advantage, while Father D&aacute;maso, turning pale at the sight,
stared at the youth with eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have the honor of presenting to
you Don Crisostomo Ibarra, the son of my deceased friend,&rdquo; said
Captain Tiago. &ldquo;The young man has just arrived from Europe, and I
have been to meet him.&rdquo; At the mere mention of the name,
exclamations were heard in all parts of the room. The lieutenant,
forgetting himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>entirely, did not stop to salute his host, but at
once approached the young man and surveyed him from head to foot. The
youth exchanged the usual greetings with those who had gathered around
him. He showed no striking peculiarity, except in his sombre dress,
which was in deep contrast with that of the other persons present. His
athletic build, his appearance, and every movement he made showed,
however, that a fine mind and a healthy body had both been highly
developed. You could see from his frank and vivacious face that he had
Spanish blood in his veins. Although his hair, eyes and complexion were
dark, his cheeks had a slight color, due, no doubt, to residence in
cold countries.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed with
glad surprise, &ldquo;the parish priest of my own town! Father
D&aacute;maso, my father&rsquo;s intimate friend!&rdquo; Every one in
the room looked at the Franciscan, but the latter made no motion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You must excuse me, if I have made
a mistake,&rdquo; added Ibarra, somewhat in doubt because of the apathy
of the friar.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have made no mistake,&rdquo;
the priest finally answered in a strained voice, &ldquo;but your father
was never an intimate friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra slowly withdrew the hand which he had offered, looking at the
friar with great surprise. As he turned about, he came face to face
with the lieutenant just approaching.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My boy, are you the son of Don
Rafael Ibarra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man bowed in acquiescence. Father D&aacute;maso settled
back into his arm-chair and fixed his eyes upon the lieutenant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Welcome to your country! May you
be more happy in it than was your father!&rdquo; exclaimed the officer
in a trembling voice. &ldquo;I had many dealings with your father and I
knew him well, and I can say that he was one of the most worthy and
honorable men in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Ibarra with
emotion, &ldquo;your praise of my father puts me in doubt as to his
fate. Even now I, his own son, am ignorant of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the old man filled with tears. He turned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>and
hurriedly withdrew. Ibarra found himself standing alone in the middle
of the room. His host had disappeared, and he turned to a group of
gentlemen, who, as soon as they saw him coming, formed a semicircle to
receive him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;in Germany, when a stranger attends any social function and
there is no one present to introduce him, it is allowable for him to
introduce himself. Permit me to avail myself of this practice.
Gentlemen, my name is Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin.&rdquo; The
others gave their names in turn, of which the most were comparatively
unknown.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My name is
A&mdash;&mdash;a,&rdquo; said one of the young men, bowing stiffly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, perhaps, I have the honor of
addressing the poet whose works have kept up my enthusiasm for my
country? I have been told that you have stopped writing, but no one has
told me why.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why? Because there is no use in
invoking the muses for false and foolish ends. A case has been made out
against one man for having put into verse a true story of Pero Grullo.
I am not going to get myself into a similar scrape. They may call me a
poet, but they shall not call me a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And can you not tell us what that
true story was?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes. The poet said that the son of
a lion is also a lion, and for saying this he narrowly escaped being
banished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dinner is ready,&rdquo; announced
a waiter who had been borrowed from the C&aacute;f&eacute;
Campa&ntilde;a. The guests began to file into the dining room, not,
however, without many sighs, and even some prayers among the women,
especially the natives, that the dreaded affair would soon be over.

<h2 class="main">At the Dinner Table.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Father Sibyla wore a satisfied air. He moved along
tranquilly, and his closed, thin lips showed no signs of disdain. On
the other hand, the Franciscan was in a very bad humor. As he walked
toward the table, he kicked over the chairs which happened to be in his
way and boxed the ears of one of the cadets. The lieutenant was very
solemn and grave.</p>
<p>The two friars instinctively started for the head of the table,
perhaps by force of habit, and, as might have been expected, they met
on opposite sides of the same chair. Then, with ponderous courtesy,
each entreated the other to sit down, giving in turn his reasons why
the other should take precedence. Every one at the table understood how
both really felt in the matter, and all knew well that the one who did
not take the coveted seat would grumble discontentedly for the
remainder of the evening. The farce proceeded something like this:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You take it, Brother
D&aacute;maso! It is for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, you take it, Brother
Sibyla!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are an old friend of the
family, the confessor of its deepest mysteries; your age, your dignity,
your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, that is all right as far as
age goes, but, on the other hand you are the priest of this
suburb,&rdquo; answered Father D&aacute;maso in an insincere tone,
without, however, leaving the chair.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As you order it, I obey,&rdquo;
concluded Father Sibyla, making ready to sit down.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But I do not order it,&rdquo;
protested the Franciscan, &ldquo;I do not <i>order</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Sibyla was about to take the seat without any further regard
to the protests of his brother, when his eyes chanced to meet those of
the lieutenant. According to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12"
href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>religious customs in the
Philippines, the highest military officer is inferior to even a convent
cook. &ldquo;<i lang="la">Cedent arma tog&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; said
Cicero in the Senate. &ldquo;<i lang="la">Cedent arma
cott&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; say the friars in the Philippines. Father
Sibyla, however, was a person of some culture and refinement, and, as
soon as he noticed the expression on the lieutenant&rsquo;s face, said:
&ldquo;Here! We are now out in the world, and not in the Church. This
seat belongs to you, lieutenant!&rdquo; But, to judge from the tone of
his voice, he thought that, although he was out in the world and not in
the Church, the seat nevertheless belonged to him. The lieutenant,
either to save himself trouble or in order to avoid sitting between two
friars, declined the honor in a very few words.</p>
<p>Neither of the disputants had thought of the owner of the house.
Ibarra saw him looking upon the scene and smiling with
satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How is this, Don Santiago!
Aren&rsquo;t you going to sit down with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all of the seats were already occupied, and Lucullus did not
dine in the house of Lucullus.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sit still! Don&rsquo;t get
up!&rdquo; said Captain Tiago, laying his hand on the young man&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;The fact is that this feast is given in honor of the
Virgin on account of your safe arrival. Here! Bring on the
<i>tinola</i>! I ordered some <i>tinola</i> made expressly for you, for
I feel quite certain that you have not had any since you left the
Philippines a long while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large dish was brought in, still steaming and filled to the brim
with <i>tinola</i>. The Dominican, after murmuring the
<i>Benedicite</i> (to which only a few of those present could give the
response), began to serve the contents of the dish. Either from
carelessness or for some other reason, he passed to Father
D&aacute;maso a plate filled with the soup and stew, but containing
only two small pieces of chicken, a bony neck and a tough wing.
Meanwhile the others, especially Ibarra, were eating all sorts of
choice bits. The Franciscan, of course, noticed this, mussed over the
stew, took a mouthful of the soup, dropped his spoon with a clatter
into his plate, and pushed the dish to one side. While this was going
on, the Dominican appeared to be absorbed in conversation with the
young <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>blonde. Se&ntilde;or Laruja had also begun to
converse with Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How long has it been since you
were last in this country?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;About seven years,&rdquo;
responded Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You must have forgotten all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;On the contrary, although my
country seems to have forgotten me, I have always kept her in
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
interposed the blonde.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I mean that for over a year I have
not received any news from here, so that now I feel like a total
stranger. I do not yet know how or when my father died.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the
lieutenant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where have you been that you did
not telegraph?&rdquo; asked one of the ladies. &ldquo;When I was
married, we telegraphed to the Peninsula.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, for the last two
years I have been in northern Europe, in Germany and in
Poland.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what country of Europe do you
like best?&rdquo; asked the young blonde, who had been listening
interestedly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;After Spain, which is my second
fatherland, oh&mdash;any free country in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You seem to have travelled a great
deal&mdash;what is the most remarkable thing that you have
observed?&rdquo; asked Laruja.</p>
<p>Ibarra appeared to be reflecting on the question. &ldquo;Remarkable?
In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For instance, in the life of the
different peoples,&mdash;their social, political and religious
life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra meditated for some little time. &ldquo;I always made it a
point to study the history of a country before visiting it, and I find
that national development invariably follows perfectly natural rules. I
have always noticed that the prosperity or poverty of different peoples
is in direct proportion to their liberties or their lack of liberty,
or, in other words, in proportion to the sacrifices or selfishness of
their forefathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And is that all you have
observed?&rdquo; asked the Franciscan, with a loud laugh. Up to this
time, he had not uttered a single word, but had given his attention to
the dinner. &ldquo;It was not worth while to squander your fortune
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>for the purpose of learning such a trifle&mdash;a
thing that every school boy knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him intently, doubtful what to say. The guests
glanced at each other, fearing that a quarrel would break out.
&ldquo;The dinner has been too long, and Your Reverence is affected by
too much wine,&rdquo; Ibarra was about to reply, but he checked himself
in time and only said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, do not wonder at the
familiarity with which our old parish priest treats me. He treated me
this way when I was a child, and the years that have passed since then
have not changed His Reverence. I derive a certain amount of pleasure
from it, for I am reminded of those days when His Reverence was a
frequent visitor at our house and honored my father&rsquo;s
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dominican glanced furtively at the Franciscan, who was
trembling. Ibarra continued, rising from his chair: &ldquo;You will
allow me to withdraw, for I have only just arrived, and I must leave
town to-morrow. Besides, I have a great many things to do before I
leave. The dinner is practically finished, and I drink very little wine
and scarcely touch spirits. Gentlemen, here&rsquo;s to Spain and the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, he emptied the glass, which, until then, he had not
touched. The old lieutenant followed his example, but said nothing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not go!&rdquo; said Captain
Tiago to him in a low voice. &ldquo;Maria Clara is coming immediately.
Isabel has just gone to get her. The new parish priest of your town is
also coming, and he is a saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall come to-morrow before I
leave. I have to make a most important visit yet to-night, and really
must go!&rdquo; With this he took his departure. In the meantime, the
Franciscan had recovered himself.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You see how it is,&rdquo; said he
to the young blonde, gesticulating with his dessert knife. &ldquo;It is
nothing but pride. He could not bear to have a priest reprove him. Can
decent people believe it? This is the evil consequence of sending young
men to Europe. The Government ought to prohibit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, the young blonde wrote, among other things, in the first
chapter of his &ldquo;Colonial Studies&rdquo;: &ldquo;How the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>neck and wing of a chicken in a friar&rsquo;s
plate of <i>tinola</i> can disturb the gayety of a feast!&rdquo; And
among his other observations were the following: &ldquo;In the
Philippines the most insignificant person at a dinner or a feast is the
host. The owner of the house has only to remain out in the street, and
everything will go along beautifully. In the present state of affairs,
it would be well to forbid the Filipinos to leave their country, and
not to teach them how to read.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">Ibarra was still confused, but the evening breeze,
which, in Manila, is at this time of the year always cool and
refreshing, seemed gently to lift the hazy mist which hung over his
eyes. He removed his hat and drew a deep, long breath.</p>
<p>Men of all nationalities passed by in swift carriages or in
slow-going, rented <i>calesas</i>. He was walking at that slow pace
characteristic alike of deep thought and laziness, and was making his
way toward the Plaza of Binondo. He looked about in search of any old
and familiar objects. Yes, there were the same old streets, the same
old houses with white and blue fronts, the same old walls covered with
whitewash or repainted in poor imitation of granite; there was the same
old church tower, its clock with transparent face still marking the
hours; there, too, were the old Chinese shops, with their dirty
curtains and iron rods, one of which remained unrepaired as he himself
had bent it when a boy.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Things go slowly here!&rdquo; he
muttered and continued up the street past the vestry.</p>
<p>As they dished up flavored ices, the street <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e909" title="Source: venders">vendors</span> were still crying
&ldquo;sorbettes.&rdquo; The same little cocoanut oil lamps furnished
light for the stands where native women and Chinese disposed of their
sweetmeats and fruit.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is marvellous,&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;There is the same Chinaman who was at that stand
seven years ago. There is that same old woman whom I remember so well.
Why, one might think my seven years in Europe but a night&rsquo;s
sleep. And, by heavens, they have not yet repaired this broken place in
the pavement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the stone which had been torn out of the pavement before he
left Manila had not yet been replaced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>While he was meditating
upon the wonderful stability of things in so unstable a country, some
one placed a hand upon his shoulder. With a start he looked up, and his
eyes met those of the old lieutenant, who also had left the
Captain&rsquo;s house. A smile had displaced the officer&rsquo;s usual
harsh expression and characteristic frown.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Be careful, young man!&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Remember what happened to your father!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I beg your pardon. You seem to
have esteemed my father very highly. Can you tell me what has been his
fate?&rdquo; asked Ibarra, gazing intently into the lieutenant&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you not know?&rdquo; said the
officer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I asked Don Santiago, but he said
that he would tell me nothing until to-morrow. Have you no information
regarding him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why, yes; everybody knows about
him. He died in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man stepped back and stared wildly at the officer.
&ldquo;In prison! Who died in prison?&rdquo; he asked in
astonishment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why, your father, who had been
arrested,&rdquo; answered the officer somewhat surprised.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! My father in prison!
Arrested and imprisoned! Man, what are you talking about? Do you know
who my father was? Are you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; asked the young man,
nervously grasping the officer&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I am
mistaken: Don Rafael Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes. Don Rafael Ibarra,&rdquo;
repeated the young man, scarcely able to utter the words.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I thought that you knew it,&rdquo;
said the officer, in a sympathetic voice, as he saw the emotion his
words had caused. &ldquo;I thought that you knew it; but be brave.
Here, you know, no man can be honorable without being
imprisoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I cannot believe that you are not
jesting,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, after a few minutes of deep silence.
&ldquo;Can you tell me for what offense he was imprisoned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused as if to meditate. &ldquo;It seems strange to me
that you have not been kept informed as to the affairs of your
family.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s last letter,
which I received a year ago, told me not to be uneasy if he failed to
write to me, for he was very busy. He advised me to continue my
studies, he sent me his blessing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In that case, he must have written
the letter to you shortly before his death. It is almost a year since
we buried him in his own town.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why was my father arrested?&rdquo;
asked Ibarra in a voice full of emotion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The cause of his arrest was an
honorable one. I must go to my quarters now; walk along with me and
then I can tell you on the way. Take my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked for some time in melancholy silence. Deep in thought and
nervously stroking his goatee, the officer sought inspiration before he
could begin the pitiful tale.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As you very well know,&rdquo; he
at last began, &ldquo;your father was the richest man in the province,
and, although he was loved and highly respected by many, there were
some envious persons who hated him. Your father had a great many
enemies among the priests and the Spaniards. Some months after your
departure, trouble arose between Don Rafael and Father D&aacute;maso,
but I do not know what it was all about. Father D&aacute;maso accused
your father of not attending confession. In former times, however, he
had never attended confession. Nothing was said about it, and he and
the priest were good friends, as you will remember. Furthermore, Don
Rafael was a very honorable man and much more upright and just than
many who go to confession regularly. He was very conscientious, and, in
speaking to me in regard to his troubles with Father D&aacute;maso,
used to say:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-large">&ldquo;&lsquo;Se&ntilde;or Guevara, do you
believe that God will forgive a crime, a murder for instance, simply
because that crime has been confessed to a priest&mdash;confessed to a
man who is in duty bound to keep it secret? Will God pardon a man whose
repentance is brought about by his cowardly fear of hell? I have a very
different opinion of God. I cannot see how one evil can be corrected by
another, nor how pardon can be procured by mere idle tears and
donations to the Church.&rsquo; Your father always followed the
strictest rules of morality. I may safely say that he never harmed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>any one, but, on the contrary, always sought by
doing good to offset certain unjust deeds committed by your
grandfathers. However, his troubles with the priests continued and took
on a dangerous aspect. Father D&aacute;maso alluded to him from the
pulpit, and, if he did not do so directly by name, it was an oversight
on his part, for anything might be expected from a man of his
character. I foresaw that sooner or later the affair would have a bad
ending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lieutenant paused for a few minutes and then continued:
&ldquo;About this time there came to the province a man who had been in
the artillery, but had been thrown out of the ranks on account of his
brutality and ignorance. This man had to make a livelihood. He was not
allowed to engage in the work of an ordinary laborer, since that might
damage Spain&rsquo;s prestige, but somehow obtained the position of
collector of taxes on vehicles. He had no education whatever, and the
natives soon found it out. A Spaniard who cannot read and write is a
wonder to them, and hence he became the subject of all sorts of
ridicule. Knowing that he was being laughed at, he became ashamed to
collect his taxes. This had a bad effect on his character, which was
already bad enough. People used to give him documents upside down to
see him pretend to read them. He would make a show of doing so, and
then, on the first blank space he found, would fill in some sprawling
characters which, I may say, represented him very accurately. The
natives continued to pay their taxes, but kept on ridiculing him. He
fairly raved with anger and worked himself up to such a frame of mind
that he respected none. Finally, he had some words with your father. It
happened that one day, while the collector was studying a document
which had been given to him in a store, some school boys came along.
One of them called the attention of his companions to the collector,
and they all began to laugh and point their fingers at the unhappy man.
The collector finally lost his patience, turned quickly and chased his
tormentors. The boys, of course, ran in all directions, at the same
time mimicking a child learning the alphabet. Blind with rage because
he could not reach them, he threw his cane, struck one of the boys on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>the head and knocked him down. Not content with
this, he went up and kicked the boy several times. Unfortunately, your
father happened to be passing just at the moment. Indignant at what he
saw, he seized the tax collector by the arm and severely reproached him
for his actions. The tax collector in anger raised his cane to strike,
but your father was too quick for him. With that strength which he
inherited from his forefathers, he, as some say, struck the collector,
or, as others claim, only gave him a push. The fact is that the man
staggered and fell to the ground, and, in falling, struck his head
against a stone. Don Rafael quietly lifted up the wounded boy and
carried him to the court house near by, leaving the collector where he
had fallen. The ex-artilleryman began to bleed at the mouth and died
without regaining consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Naturally the law stepped in. They
showered calumnies of all kinds upon your father and accused him of
being a heretic and a revolutionist. To be a heretic is a great
misfortune anywhere or at any time, but it was especially so at this
particular time, for the chief magistrate of the province was the
loudest prayer maker in the Church. To be a revolutionist is still
worse. One might better have killed three highly educated tax
collectors than be thus accused. Everybody deserted your father, and
his books and papers were seized. He was accused of being a subscriber
to &lsquo;El Correo del Ultramar&rsquo; and to Madrid newspapers, of
having sent you to Germany, of having in his possession incriminating
papers and pictures, and&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know what not. He
was even attacked because, although he was the descendant of Spaniards,
he wore the dress of the natives. If your father had been anybody else,
he would have been acquitted, for the doctors pronounced the death of
the collector due to natural causes. His fortune, however, his
confidence in the law, and his hatred for everything which seemed
unlawful and unjust, cost him his life. I myself, much as I dislike
begging for mercy, called upon the Governor General, the predecessor of
the present Governor. I brought out the fact that a man who aided every
poor Spaniard, who gave food and shelter to all, and whose veins were
filled with the generous blood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>of Spain&mdash;such a man could
not be a revolutionist. In vain I argued for him, pledged my own life
for him, and swore by my military honor. What did it all amount to? I
was badly received, curtly and summarily dismissed, and called a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused to take breath. His young companion neither
looked up nor made a sound. The narrator proceeded: &ldquo;I took
charge of the case for your father. I called upon the celebrated
Filipino lawyer, young A&mdash;&mdash;a, but he refused to undertake
the defense. &lsquo;I would lose the case,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my
defense would cause new accusations against him, and perhaps bring them
upon me. Go and see Se&ntilde;or M&mdash;&mdash;, who is an eloquent
orator, a Spaniard and a man of great reputation.&rsquo; I did so, and
the celebrated lawyer took charge of the case, which he conducted in a
masterful and brilliant manner. But your father had many enemies, some
of whom did their work secretly. There were many false witnesses in the
case, and their calumnies, which anywhere else would have been
overthrown by a single sarcastic phrase from the defending attorney,
were here given a great deal of weight. As fast as the attorney proved
the falsity of their accusations, new charges were brought forward.
They accused him of having wrongfully taken possession of a large tract
of land. They sued him for damages and for injuries caused. They said
that he had dealings with the organized bandits or <i>tulisanes</i>,
and that thus he had been able to keep his property unmolested. In
fact, the case became so complicated that within a year no one
understood it. The chief magistrate was called away from his post and
replaced by another of good reputation, but unfortunately this
magistrate, too, was displaced in a few months.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The sufferings, disappointments
and discomforts of prison life, and his great grief at seeing the
ingratitude of so many supposed friends, finally broke down your
father&rsquo;s iron constitution and he became fatally ill. When it was
all over; when he had proved himself not guilty of being an enemy to
his country, and innocent of the death of the tax collector, he died in
prison, with no one to care for him in his last hours. I arrived just
as he was expiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man had finished all he had to say. Ibarra, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>overcome
with grief at the pathetic story he had heard, could not utter a word.
The two had arrived at the gate of the barracks. Stopping and shaking
hands with the young man, the officer said: &ldquo;My boy, Captain
Tiago can give you the details. I must say good night, for my duty
calls me.&rdquo; With deep emotion, Ibarra grasped the lean hand of the
lieutenant, and then looked after him in silence until he disappeared
in the building. Turning slowly about, he saw a carriage passing and
made a sign to the cabman.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Lala&rsquo;s Hotel,&rdquo; he said
in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This fellow is just out of
jail,&rdquo; said the cabman to himself as he whipped up his horses.

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Captain Tiago.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Captain Tiago was short in stature, but both his body
and his face were well filled out. His complexion was clear and he did
not appear to be more than thirty or thirty-five years old, although he
was really more than that. In these times his face always wore a
pleasant expression. His head was small, round and covered with hair as
black as ebony, long in front and very short behind. This head,
according to reports, contained a great many things. His eyes were
small but not terrifying, and always without expression. In short, the
Captain might have passed for a good-looking little man, if his mouth
had not been disfigured by the use of tobacco and the betel nut, the
juices of which trickled out of the corners of his lips and destroyed
the symmetry of his features. However, despite these habits, both his
own teeth and the two that the dentist had made for him, at twelve
<i>pesos</i> each, were well preserved.</p>
<p>Tiago was considered one of the richest property owners in Binondo,
and he also owned large plantations in the provinces of Pampanga and
Laguna de Bay, especially in the town of San Diego. The rent of all
these lands increased every year. San Diego was his favorite town on
account of its excellent bathing place, its famous cockpit and the
pleasant memories associated with the neighborhood. He spent at least
two months in this town every year. Captain Tiago also had a great deal
of property in Santo Cristo, in Analoague Street and in Rosario Street.
In partnership with a Chinaman he carried on a profitable business in
opium. It is understood that he had contracts with the Government for
feeding the prisoners in Bilibid and that he supplied fodder to many of
the principal houses in Manila. He was in good standing with the
authorities, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>able, clever, and even daring in his speculations
in the necessities of others. Hence it was that at this time the
Captain was as happy as a narrow-minded man could be in such a country.
He was rich, and was at peace with God, the Government and man.</p>
<p>That Tiago was at peace with God was indisputable. In fact, there
was no reason whatever for his not being so, since he was well situated
as far as worldly matters go and had never loaned God any money. He
never addressed God in his prayers, not even when he was in dire
straits. He was rich, and his money, he thought, could pray for him.
For masses and prayers, God had created powerful and lofty priests; for
special religious functions and rosaries, God, in His infinite
goodness, for the benefit of the rich, had created poor
people&mdash;poor people who for a <i>peso</i> would make half a dozen
prayers, and would read all the Holy Books, even to the Hebrew Bible,
if the pay were large enough. If at any time he found himself in hard
straits and needed heavenly aid and was out of red Chinese candles, he
applied to the saints, making them great promises in order to win their
favor and convince them of his good intentions.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago was therefore beloved by the priests, respected by the
sacristans, fondled by the Chinese candle-makers and fire-cracker
merchants, and thoroughly happy in the religion of the world. Some even
attributed to him great influence in the ecclesiastical court.</p>
<p>That the Captain was at peace with the Government must not be
doubted simply because such a thing seems impossible. Incapable of
conceiving a new idea and content with the <i>modus vivendi</i>, he was
always willing to obey the latest official recruit in any of the
Government offices and even ready to give him at all times of the year
such presents as hams, capons, turkeys, and Chinese fruit. He was the
first to applaud any tax imposed by the Government, especially when he
scented behind it a chance of securing the contract for its collection.
He always kept orchestras on hand to serenade Government officials of
all grades from governor to the lowest Government agent, on their
birthdays, saint&rsquo;s days, or when any occasion, such as the death
of any of their relatives, or a birth in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>family
connection should afford a pretext. He even went so far as to dedicate
laudatory verses to his royal patrons on these occasions, thus honoring
the &ldquo;suave and loving governor&rdquo; or the &ldquo;valiant and
mighty alcalde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain was a petty governor or <i>gobernadorcillo</i> of a rich
colony of <i>mestizos</i>, in spite of the protests of many who
considered him unfit for the position. He held the office for two
years, but during this time he wore out ten frock coats, about the same
number of high hats, and lost more than a half dozen of
<i>gobernadorcillo</i> canes. His high hat and frock coat were always
in evidence in the city hall, at the Government palace in
Melaca&ntilde;an<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1027src" href="#xd21e1027"
name="xd21e1027src">1</a> and at the army headquarters, and they always
appeared, too, in the cock-pit, in the market, in all processions, and
in the Chinese shops. Dressed in this official costume with the
tasseled cane, Captain Tiago was to be found everywhere, arranging,
ordering, and putting in disorder, everything with which he had
anything to do&mdash;and all with wonderful activity and with still
more wonderful gravity.</p>
<p>Sacrilegious people called him a fool; poor people called him a
hypocrite, a cruel man who gained a livelihood by making others
miserable; while his inferiors looked upon him as a despot and a
tyrant. And the women? Ah, the women! Slanderous rumors circulated in
the wretched <i>nipa</i> houses, and it was claimed that often
lamentations and sobs, mingled with the cries of a child, could be
heard. More than one young girl was pointed out by the malicious finger
of the neighbors, with the remark: &ldquo;See what a different
expression she wears, and how plainly she shows evidences of her
shame.&rdquo; But such things as these never robbed the Captain of any
sleep; no young girl disturbed his rest.</p>
<p>Such was the Captain at that time. His past history was as follows:
He was the only son of a very wealthy but avaricious sugar manufacturer
of Malabon, who was unwilling to spend a cent in his education. For
this reason young Santiago became the servant of a good Dominican, a
very virtuous man, who tried to teach him all the valuable knowledge
which he possessed. About the time when he was to have the happiness of
studying logic, the death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>of his protector, followed by that of
his father, put an end to his studies and from that time on he devoted
himself to business. He married a beautiful girl from Santa Cruz, who
increased his fortune and gave him a social position.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Pia Alba was not content with buying sugar, coffee and
indigo; she wished to sow and reap, so the young husband bought lands
in San Diego. It was in this town that he made the acquaintance and
friendship of Father D&aacute;maso and of Don Rafael Ibarra, the
richest capitalist of the town.</p>
<p>The lack of an heir for the first six years of his married life gave
him a great opportunity to accumulate wealth, which perhaps was a
censurable ambition. Although Do&ntilde;a Pia was handsome, robust and
well formed, she made her pilgrimages in vain. By advice of the
devotees of San Diego, she visited the Virgin of Cayasay in Taal; she
gave alms, and she danced in the procession before the Virgin of
Turumba in Pakil under the May sun, but it was all in vain. Finally, on
the advice of Father D&aacute;maso, she went to Obando, and there
danced at the <i>fiesta</i> of San Pascual Bailon and asked for a son.
It is well known that in Obando there is a trinity&mdash;Our Lady of
Salambau, Santa Clara and San Pascual&mdash;which grants sons or
daughters as required. Thanks to this wise triumvirate, Do&ntilde;a Pia
became a mother, but like the fisherman in Macbeth, who ceased to sing
after he found a rich treasure, Do&ntilde;a Pia lost her gayety, became
very sad and was never seen to smile again. Every one, even to Captain
Tiago, declared that it was a pure caprice. A puerperal fever put an
end to her grief, leaving a beautiful daughter motherless. Father
D&aacute;maso baptized the child, and, as San Pascual had not given the
son which had been asked for, the name of Maria Clara was given to it
in honor of the Virgin of Salambau and of Santa Clara. The little girl
grew up under the care of her aunt Isabel,&mdash;that good old lady
with the manners of a friar whom we met before. The little girl lived
the greater part of the time in San Diego on account of the healthful
climate, and while there Father D&aacute;maso paid her much
attention.</p>
<p>Maria Clara did not have the small eyes of her father. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>Like her
mother, her eyes were large, black and shaded by long lashes, brilliant
and smiling when she was playing, but sad, deep and pensive at other
times. When a child her wavy hair was almost blond. Her nose was well
formed, neither too large nor too flat. Her mouth was small and
beautifully shaped like that of her mother, and her cheeks were set
with dimples. Her skin was like silk and as white as snow, but her fond
parent found traces of the paternity of Captain Tiago in her small and
well shaped ears.</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel attributed the child&rsquo;s semi-European features to
impressions made upon Do&ntilde;a Pia. She remembered having seen the
mother a short time before the child was born, weeping before the image
of San Antonio. Then, too, a cousin of Captain Tiago had the same
features, the only difference being in the choice of the saints, by
which the phenomenon was explained. With her it was either the Virgin
or San Miguel. A cousin of Captain Tiago, a famous philosopher, who
knew Amat<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1053src" href="#xd21e1053" name=
"xd21e1053src">2</a> by heart, explained it all by attributing it to
the effect of the planets.</p>
<p>Maria Clara, the idol of all, grew up surrounded by love and smiles.
She won the favor of even the friars when she was dressed in white for
some religious procession, her long, wavy hair interwoven with flowers,
two silver or golden wings attached to the shoulders of her dress, and
holding two white doves, tied with blue ribbons, in her hand. When she
grew up, she was so full of childish mischief that Captain Tiago did
nothing but bless the saints of Obando and advise everybody to buy
handsome statues of that trinity.</p>
<p>In tropical countries a girl becomes a woman at the age of thirteen
or fourteen years, like the plant which buds at night and blooms the
following morning. During this period of transition, so full of mystery
and romance, on the advice of the parish priest, Maria Clara entered
the religious retreat of Santa Catalina in order to receive from the
nuns a strictly religious education. She left Father D&aacute;maso in
tears, and likewise the only friend of her childhood, Crisostomo
Ibarra. Shortly after the entrance to the convent, Ibarra went to
Europe. For seven <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"
name="pb28">28</a>]</span>long years, the girl lived under the
vigilance of the Mother Superior in the iron-grated building, shut off
from any communication with the outer world.</p>
<p>Don Rafael and Captain Tiago, in the meantime, while Ibarra was in
Europe and Maria Clara in the convent, noticing the trend of affairs,
and at the same time having in mind their own interests, decided that
the children should be married. It is needless to say that this
agreement, which was arrived at some years after Ibarra had left for
Europe, was celebrated with equal joy by two hearts, on opposite sides
of the world and amid very different surroundings. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the morning after the dinner party, Aunt Isabel and
Maria Clara went to mass early: the former carefully carrying her
glasses, so that she might be able to read &ldquo;The Anchor of
Salvation&rdquo; during communion; the latter beautifully dressed,
carrying her rosary of blue beads as a bracelet. The priest had
scarcely left the altar when, to the disgust and surprise of her good
aunt, who thought that her niece was as pious and as fond of prayer as
a nun, the young girl desired to go home. After a great deal of
grumbling, the old lady crossed herself several times, and the two
arose to leave. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Maria, to cut off the
scolding, &ldquo;the good God will pardon me. He ought to understand
the heart of a girl better than you, Aunt Isabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast, Maria Clara occupied herself with some embroidery
while her aunt bustled about with a duster removing the traces of the
social event of the preceding evening. Captain Tiago was busy examining
some papers.</p>
<p>Every noise in the street and every passing carriage made the girl
tremble with anxiety and wish that she were again back in the convent
among her friends. There, she thought, she could see him without
trembling and with perfect equanimity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I believe, Maria, that the doctor
is right,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago. &ldquo;You ought to go to the
provinces. You are looking very pale and need a change of air. How does
Malabon strike you, or San Diego?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mere mention of the latter name, Maria Clara blushed and was
unable to speak.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now, you and Isabel go to the
convent to get your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>things and say good bye to your
friends,&rdquo; continued the Captain, without raising his head.
&ldquo;You will not return there. And in four or five days, when your
clothes are ready we shall go to Malabon. &mdash;Your godfather, by the
way, is not in San Diego at present. The priest whom you saw here last
night, that young fellow, is now the priest in the town. He is a
saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I think you will find San Diego
better, cousin,&rdquo; said Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;Our house there is
better than the one in Malabon, and besides, it is nearly time for the
<i>fiesta</i> to take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara was about to embrace her aunt for these welcome words,
but just then a carriage stopped in front of the house and the young
girl suddenly turned pale.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the
Captain, and then, in a changed tone, exclaimed, &ldquo;Don
Crisostomo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara let fall the work which she was holding in her hands. A
nervous trembling passed over her. Then steps were heard on the stairs
and presently a young, manly voice. And, as if this voice had some
magic power, the girl shook off her emotion, started to run, and hid
herself in the oratory. Both father and aunt had to laugh at this, and
even Ibarra heard the closing of the door behind her.</p>
<p>Pale and panting, the girl finally subdued her emotion and began to
listen. She could hear his voice, that voice which for so long a time
she had heard only in her dreams. Beside herself with joy, she kissed
the nearest saint, which, by the way, happened to be San Antonio, the
abbot. Happy saint! Whether alive or carved in wood, always tempted in
the most charming manner! Becoming quite herself again, she looked
about for some crack through which she might get a peep at the young
man. Finally, when he came in range of the key-hole and she again saw
his fine features, her face beamed with smiles. In fact, the sight
filled her with such joy that when her aunt came to call her, Maria
Clara fell on the old lady&rsquo;s neck and kissed her repeatedly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You goose! What is the matter with
you?&rdquo; the old lady was finally able to ask, after wiping away her
tears. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>Maria Clara, in her modesty, covered her face with her round
arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come! Hurry up and get yourself
ready!&rdquo; said the old lady in an affectionate tone. &ldquo;While
he is talking with your father about you&mdash;&mdash; Come, do not
waste time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not respond, but allowed herself to be picked up like a
child and carried to her room.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago and Ibarra were talking earnestly when at last Aunt
Isabel appeared, half dragging her niece by the hand. At first the girl
looked in every direction but at the persons present. At last, however,
her eyes met Ibarra&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The conversation of the young lovers was at first confined to the
usual trifling remarks, those pleasant little things which, like the
boasts of European nations, are enjoyable and interesting to those who
are concerned and understand them, but ridiculous to outsiders.</p>
<p>Finally, she, like all sisters of Cain, was moved by jealously and
asked: &ldquo;Have you always thought of me? Have you never forgotten
me in your many travels among so many great cities and among such
beautiful women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he, a true brother of Cain, dodged the issue, and, being
something of a diplomat, answered: &ldquo;Could I forget you?&rdquo;
And then, gazing into her deep, dark eyes, &ldquo;Could I break a
sacred vow? Do you remember that stormy night when you, seeing me in
tears beside my dead mother, came to me and placed your hand&mdash;that
hand which I have not touched for so long&mdash;upon my shoulder, and
said: &lsquo;You have lost your mother,&mdash;I never had one.&rsquo;
And then you wept with me. You loved my mother, and she loved you as
only a mother can love a daughter. It was raining then, you will
remember, and the lightning flashed, but I seemed to hear music and to
see a smile on the face of my dead mother.&mdash;O, if my parents were
only living and could see you now!&mdash;That night I took your hand
and, joining it with my mother&rsquo;s, I swore always to love you and
make you happy, no matter what fate Heaven might have in store for me.
I have never regretted that vow, and now renew it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Since the day that I bade you
good-bye and entered the convent,&rdquo; she answered, smiling,
&ldquo;I have always remembered you, and have never forgotten you in
spite of the commands of my confessor, who imposed severe penances on
me. I remembered the little games we used to play together and our
little quarrels. When we were children you used to find in the river
the most beautiful shells for our games of <i>siklot</i> and the finest
and most beautifully colored stones for our game of <i>sinkat</i>. You
were always very slow and stupid and lost, but you always paid the
forfeit, which I gave you with the palm of my hand. But I always tried
to strike lightly, for I was sorry for you. You always cheated, even
more than I, in the game of <i>chouka</i> and we generally quarrelled
over it. Do you remember that time when you really became angry? Then
you made me suffer, but when I found that I had no one to quarrel with,
we made peace immediately. We were still children when we went with
your mother one day to bathe in the stream under the shade of the
reeds. Many flowers and plants grew on the bank of the river, and you
used to tell me their strange Latin and Spanish names, for you were
then studying at the Athen&aelig;um. I paid little attention, but
amused myself by chasing butterflies and in trying to catch the little
fish which slipped away from me so easily among the rocks and weeds of
the shore. You suddenly disappeared from sight, but when you returned
you brought a wreath of orange flowers and placed it on my head. On our
way home, as the sun was hot, I collected some sage leaves from the
side of the road for you to put into your hat and thus prevent
headache. Then you laughed, we made up, and came the remainder of the
way home hand in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra smiled as he listened attentively to every detail of the
story. Opening his pocket book, he took out a paper in which he had
wrapped some withered but fragrant sage leaves. &ldquo;Your sage
leaves,&rdquo; said he in answer to her questioning glance. &ldquo;The
only thing you have ever given me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, in turn, drew a little, white satin bag from the bosom of her
dress. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said, tapping his hand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>with her
own. &ldquo;You must not touch it; it is a letter of
farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The one that I wrote you before
leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My dear sir, have you ever written
any other?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what did I say
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Many falsehoods; excuses of a bad
debtor,&rdquo; replied she, smiling and showing how agreeable these
falsehoods had been to her. &ldquo;But be quiet! I will read it to you,
but I will omit your polite speeches out of consideration for your
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raising the paper to the height of her eyes, in order to conceal her
face, she began. &ldquo;&lsquo;My&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; I shall not
read you what follows that, for it is not true.&rdquo; She ran her eyes
over some lines and began to read again: &ldquo;&lsquo;My father wishes
me to go away, in spite of my entreaties. He says that I am a man and
must think of my future and my duty; that I must learn how to live,
which I cannot do in my own country, so that in the future I may be of
some use. He says that if I remain at his side, in his shadow, in this
atmosphere of business, I will never learn how to look ahead, and that
when he is gone, I shall be like the plant of which our poet Baltazar
speaks&mdash;as it always lives in the water, it never learns how to
endure a moment&rsquo;s heat.&mdash;He reproached me because I wept,
and his reproach hurt me so that I confessed that I loved you. My
father stopped, thought a moment and, placing his hand on my shoulder,
said in a trembling voice: &ldquo;Do you think that you alone know how
to love, that your father does not love you, and that his heart is not
pained at being separated from you? It is a short time since your
mother died, and I am already reaching that age when the help and
counsel of youth are needed. And yet I consent to your going, not even
knowing that I shall ever see you again. The future is opening to you,
but closing to me. Your loves are being born; mine are dying. Fire
blazes in your blood, but cold is gradually finding its way into mine.
And yet you weep, and are not willing to sacrifice the present for a
future useful to yourself and your country.&rdquo; The eyes of my
father filled with tears and I fell upon my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>knees at
his feet and embraced him. I asked his pardon and said that I was
willing to go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emotion which Ibarra manifested put an end to the reading. As
pale as death, he arose and began to walk nervously from one side to
the other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have made me forget that I
have duties to perform, and that I ought to leave immediately for my
town. To-morrow is the <i>fiesta</i> in memory of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara stopped and silently fixed her large and dreamy eyes
upon him for some minutes. Then taking some flowers from a vase near
by, she said with emotion: &ldquo;Go! I do not wish to detain you. We
shall see each other again in a few days. Place these flowers on the
graves of your father and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, Ibarra descended the stairs, accompanied by
Captain Tiago and Do&ntilde;a Isabel, while Maria Clara locked herself
up in the oratory.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do me the favor to tell Andeng to
get the house ready, and that Maria and Isabel are coming. A pleasant
journey!&rdquo; While the Captain was saying this, Ibarra got into the
carriage and drove off in the direction of the Plaza of San
Gabriel.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the Captain shouted to Maria Clara, who was
weeping by the side of the image of the Virgin: &ldquo;Hurry up and
light two <i>peseta</i> candles in honor of San Roque and another in
honor of San Rafael, the patron saint of travellers. And light the lamp
of Our Lady of Peace and Protector of Travellers, for there are many
bandits about. It is better to spend four <i>reales</i> for wax and six
<i>cuartos</i> for oil than to have to pay a big ransom later
on.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Father D&aacute;maso drove up in front of Captain
Tiago&rsquo;s house and the Franciscan stepped to the ground just as
Aunt Isabel and Maria Clara were getting into their silver-trimmed
carriage. They saluted Father D&aacute;maso, and he, in his
preoccupation, gently patted Maria Clara on the cheek.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; the
friar asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To the convent to get my
things,&rdquo; replied the younger.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, ha! Ah, ha! We&rsquo;ll see
who is the stronger. We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; he muttered and turned
away, leaving the two women in wonder as to what it all meant. The
friar stepped along lightly, and reaching the stairs, went up.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He must be studying his
sermon,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;Get in, Maria; we shall be
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Father D&aacute;maso was studying his sermon or not we
cannot say. At any rate, he was absorbed in some important matter, for
he even forgot to extend his hand to Captain Tiago upon entering,
greatly to the embarrassment of the Captain, who had to feign kissing
it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Santiago, we have some very
important matters to talk over; let us go to your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain, somewhat disturbed, was unable to reply, but he obeyed
and followed the big priest into his office. Father D&aacute;maso shut
the door behind them.</p>
<p>While they are conferring in secret, let us find out what has become
of Brother Sibyla. The wise Dominican was not to be found at his
parochial residence, for early, immediately after mass, he had gone to
the Dominican convent, situated near the gate called Isabel the Second
or Magallanes, according to which family is in power in Madrid. Paying
no attention to the delicious odor of chocolate or to the rattling of
money boxes and coins in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>the treasurer&rsquo;s office, and
scarcely answering the deferential salute of the treasurer, Father
Sibyla went upstairs, crossed several corridors and rapped on a
door.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; answered a
voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May God give back health to Your
Reverence!&rdquo; was the greeting of the young Dominican as he
entered.</p>
<p>A very feeble old priest was seated in a large arm-chair. His
complexion was as yellow as the saints which Revera paints; his eyes
were sunk deep in their orbits, and his heavy eyebrows, which were
nearly always knit in a frown, added to the brilliant glare of his
death-foreboding eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have come to talk to you about
the charge with which you have entrusted me,&rdquo; said Father
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1210" title=
"Source: Siblya">Sibyla</span>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, yes. And what about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered the young
man with disgust, seating himself and turning his face away with
disdain. &ldquo;They have been telling us a lot of lies. Young Ibarra
is a prudent boy. He does not seem to be a fool. I think he is a pretty
good sort of a chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hostilities began last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So soon? And how did it come
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Sibyla related briefly what had taken place between Father
D&aacute;maso and Crisostomo Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; he added, in
conclusion, &ldquo;the young man is going to marry that daughter of
Captain Tiago, who was educated in the college of our sisters. He is
rich and would not want to make any enemies who might cause the loss of
his happiness and his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man bowed his head as a sign of assent. &ldquo;Yes, that is
my opinion. With such a wife and such a father-in-law we can hold him
body and soul. And if not, it will be all the better for us if he
declares himself our enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Sibyla looked at the old man with surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is to say, for the good of
our whole corporation,&rdquo; he added, breathing with difficulty.
&ldquo;I prefer open attacks to the foolish praise and adulations of
friends, for, the truth is, flattery is always paid for.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Does Your Reverence think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him sadly. &ldquo;Always bear this in
mind,&rdquo; he answered, panting with fatigue, &ldquo;that our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>power will endure as long as it is believed in. If
they attack us, the Government says, &lsquo;They attack them, because
they see in them an obstacle to their liberty, therefore let us
preserve them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if the Government gives them a
hearing? Sometimes the Government&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Government will do no such
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nevertheless, if some bold and
reckless man, impelled by covetousness, should dare to think that he
wanted our possessions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, woe to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment both remained silent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; continued the
sick man, &ldquo;it will do us good to have them attack us and wake us
up. It would show us our weaknesses and strengthen us. The exaggerated
praises which we get deceive us, and put us asleep. We are becoming
ridiculous and on the day that we become ridiculous we shall fall as we
fell in Europe. Money will no longer flow into our churches, no one
will longer buy our scapularies or girdles, and when we cease to be
rich we shall no longer possess the great influence which we wield at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pshaw! We shall always have our
property, our plantations&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall lose them all as we lost
them in Europe. And the worst of it is that we are working for our own
ruin. For instance, this immeasurable ambition to raise the incomes
from our lands each year, this eagerness to increase the rents, which I
have always opposed in vain, this eagerness will be our ruin. The
natives already find themselves forced to buy land in other localities
if they want lands as good as ours. I fear that we are degenerating.
&lsquo;Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.&rsquo; For this
reason we should not be too hard on the people, for they are already
grumbling under our exactions. You have considered well. Let us leave
this thing to others, and keep up the prestige which we have and let us
endeavor to appear before God with clean hands. May the God of pity
have mercy on our weaknesses!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So you believe that the tax or
tribute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us talk no more of
money!&rdquo; interrupted the sick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>man with disgust. &ldquo;You
were saying that the lieutenant and Father D&aacute;maso last
night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Father,&rdquo; answered the
young priest smiling. &ldquo;But this morning I saw the lieutenant
again and he told me that he was sorry for what had occurred at the
dinner. He said he thought that he had been affected by too much wine
and that the same was true of Father D&aacute;maso. &lsquo;And your
boast to tell the Governor?&rsquo; I asked jokingly.
&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;I know when to make my word
good so long as it does not stain my honor. That is just the reason why
I wear only two stars.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After talking over several minor matters, Father Sibyla took his
leave.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the lieutenant had not gone to the Governor
General&rsquo;s palace in Melaca&ntilde;an with any report in regard to
the occurrence of the preceding evening. However, the Governor General
had learned of it through another source, and discussing the matter
with one of his aides, he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A woman and a priest can give no
offense. I intend to live peaceably while I remain in this country and
I do not wish to have any trouble with men who wear skirts. And,
furthermore, I have found out that the Father Provincial has evaded my
orders in this matter. I asked for the removal of that friar as a
punishment. What was done? They removed him, but they gave him another
and much better town. &lsquo;Tricks of the friars,&rsquo; as they say
in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when His Excellency found himself alone he ceased to smile.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;if the people were not so stupid
they would put a limit to their reverences. But every people deserves
its fate, and we are no different in this respect from the rest of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Captain Tiago had concluded his conference with Father
D&aacute;maso, or rather Father D&aacute;maso had concluded it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have already warned you!&rdquo;
said the Franciscan on taking his leave. &ldquo;You could have avoided
all of this had you consulted with me before, and, if you had not lied
to me, when I asked you about it. See to it that you do not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>do any more such foolish things, and have faith in
your godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tiago took two or three steps towards the <i>sala</i>,
meditating and sighing. All at once, as if some good idea had struck
him, he ran to the oratory and put out the candles and the lamps which
had been lighted for Ibarra&rsquo;s protection.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There is still time enough,&rdquo;
he murmured, &ldquo;for he has a long road to travel.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">Chapter VII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">San Diego and Its People.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Not far from the shores of the Laguna de Bay lies the
town of San Diego, surrounded by fertile fields and rice plantations.
It exports sugar, rice, coffee, and fruits, or sells them at
ridiculously low prices to the Chinese, who make large profits out of
the credulity and vices of the laborers.</p>
<p>When the sky was serene and the atmosphere clear, the boys used to
climb to the very peak of the old moss and vine covered church tower.
And what exclamations they would utter when, from that high pinnacle,
they looked out at the beautiful panorama that surrounded them. There
before them lay a great mass of roofs, some <i>nipa</i>, some thatch,
some zinc and some made out of the native grasses. And out of that
mass, which here and there gave way to an orchard or a garden, every
one of those boys could find his own little home, his own little nest.
To them everything was a landmark; every tamarind tree with its light
foliage, every cocoanut tree with its load of nuts, every bending cane,
every <i>bonga</i> tree, every cross. Beyond the town is the crystal
river, like a serpent asleep on a carpet of green. Here and there, its
tranquil surface is broken by rocks projecting from its sandy bottom.
In places, it is hemmed in between two high banks, and there the
rapidly rushing waters turn and twist the half-bared roots of the
overhanging shade trees. But further on it spreads itself out again and
becomes calm and peaceful.</p>
<p>But what always attracts attention is a peninsula of forest
projecting into this sea of cultivated land. There can be found
hollow-trunked trees, a century old, trees which die only when struck
by lightning and set on fire. They say, also, that even in that case
the fire never spreads to any other tree. This old grove is held in a
certain degree of awe, for around it have been woven many strange
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>legends. Of these the most probable, and
consequently the least known and believed is the following:</p>
<p>When the town was still a miserable group of huts, when weeds grew
in abundance in the so-called streets, and deer and wild boar roamed
about at night, there arrived one day an old Spaniard. His eyes were
deep and thoughtful and he spoke Tagalog fluently. After visiting the
different estates and peddling out some goods he inquired for the
owners of this grove, which by the way, also contained several hot
water springs. A number of persons claiming to be the owners presented
themselves, and the old man purchased from them the grove, paying in
exchange some money, jewelry and clothing. A short time afterward he
disappeared, no one knew where.</p>
<p>His sudden disappearance made the people think for a time that he
had been spirited away, but later on a fetid odor was noticeable near
the grove, and some shepherds, upon investigation, found the body of
the old man in a badly decomposed condition hanging from the limb of a
<i>balit&icirc;</i> tree. When alive the old man had terrorized many by
his deep and resonant voice, his sunken eyes and his silent laugh, but
now that he was dead, and a suicide at that, the mere mention of his
name gave the town women nightmare. Some of them threw the jewelry that
they had bought from him into the river and burned all the clothing,
and, for a long time after the body had been buried at the foot of the
<i>balit&icirc;</i> tree, no one cared to venture near it. All sort of
stories became current about the haunted place.</p>
<p>A shepherd, looking for his flock, said that he had seen lights in
the grove. A party of young men, passing near the place, heard groans
and lamentations. An unfortunate lover, in order to make an impression
on the disdainful object of his affections, promised to spend a night
under the tree and to bring her a branch from its trunk, but on the
next day he was taken ill with a quick fever and died.</p>
<p>Before many months had passed, a youth came to the town one day. He
was apparently a Spanish <i>mestizo</i>, declared himself the son of
the dead stranger, and established himself in that far-off corner of
the world. He began to farm the land and devoted himself especially to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>the cultivation of indigo. Don Saturnino was a
taciturn young man, violent and sometimes cruel, but very active and
industrious. He built a wall around his father&rsquo;s grave and, from
time to time, went all alone to visit it. A few years later he married
a young girl from Manila who bore him a son, Rafael, the father of
Crisostomo.</p>
<p>Don Rafael, from his earliest youth, was fond of farming. Under his
care, the agriculture which had been started and fostered by his father
was rapidly developed. New inhabitants flocked to the vicinity, and
among them were a great many Chinese. The village grew very fast and
was soon supporting a native priest. After it had become a
<i>pueblo</i>, the native priest died and Father D&aacute;maso took his
place.</p>
<p>Still the grave and the adjoining lands were respected. At times,
children, armed with sticks and stones, ventured to wander about,
exploring the surrounding country and gathering <i>guayabas</i>,
<i>papays</i>, <i>lomboy</i> and other native fruits. Then, all of a
sudden, while they were busily engaged collecting the fruits, some one
would catch a glimpse of the old rope hanging from the
<i>balit&icirc;</i> tree, and stones would be heard to fall. Then some
one would cry, &ldquo;The old man!&rdquo; &ldquo;The old man!&rdquo;
Dropping fruit, sticks and stones, and leaping from the trees, the boys
would flee in all directions through the thickets and between the
rocks, not stopping until they emerged from the grove, pale and
panting, some laughing, some crying.</p>
<p>You could not say that Don Rafael, while alive, was the most
influential man in San Diego, although it is true that he was the
richest, owned the most land, and had put almost everybody else under
obligations to him. He was modest and always belittled his own deeds.
He never tried to form a party of his own, and, as we have already
seen, no one came to his aid when his fortune seemed to fail him.</p>
<p>Whenever Captain Tiago arrived in town, his debtors received him
with an orchestra, gave him a banquet, and loaded him down with gifts.
If a deer or a wild boar was caught he always had a quarter of it for
his own table; if any of his debtors found a beautiful horse, within a
half hour it would be in the Captain&rsquo;s stable. All of this is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>true, but still when the Captain had his back
turned they made fun of him and referred to him as Sacristan Tiago.</p>
<p>The <i>gobernadorcillo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1356src" href=
"#xd21e1356" name="xd21e1356src">1</a> was an unhappy fellow who never
commanded but always obeyed; he never attacked any one, but was always
attacked; he never ordered anybody, but everybody ordered him; and
besides, he had to take the responsibility for everything that they had
commanded, ordered or disposed. The position had cost him five thousand
<i>pesos</i> and many humiliations, but, considering the profits he
made, the price was very cheap.</p>
<p>San Diego was like Rome; not the Rome of the time of Romulus, when
he marked out the walls with a plough, nor when, later, he bathed in
his own blood and that of others and dictated laws to the world: no,
San Diego was like the Rome of contemporaneous history, with this
difference&mdash;instead of being a city of marble, monuments and
coliseums, it was a city of <i>saual&icirc;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1366src" href="#xd21e1366" name="xd21e1366src">2</a> and
cock-pits. The parochial priest of San Diego corresponded to the Pope
in the Vatican; the <i>alferez</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1371src"
href="#xd21e1371" name="xd21e1371src">3</a> of the Civil Guard to the
King of Italy in the Quirinal, but both in the same proportion as the
<i>sauali</i> or native wood and the <i>nipa</i> cock-pits corresponded
to the monuments of marble and coliseums. And in San Diego, as in Rome,
there was continual trouble. Everybody wanted to be the leading
se&ntilde;or, and there was always some one else in the way. Let us
describe two of these ambitious citizens.</p>
<p>Friar Bernando Salvi was the young and silent Franciscan whom we
mentioned in a preceding chapter. He had even more of the customs and
manners of his brotherhood than had his predecessor, the violent Father
D&aacute;maso. He was slender, sickly, almost always pensive, and very
strict in the fulfillment of his religious duties as well as very
careful of his good name. A month after his arrival in the parish
almost all the inhabitants became brothers of the &ldquo;Venerable
Third Order,&rdquo; to the great grief of its rival, &ldquo;The
Brotherhood of the Most Sacred Rosary.&rdquo; His heart leaped with joy
at seeing on every neck in the town <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>from four to five scapularies, a
knotted cord around every waist, and every funeral procession dressed
in habits of <i>guingon</i>. The sacristan mayor or head warden of the
order made quite a little capital by selling and giving away all those
things considered necessary to save the soul and overcome the
devil.</p>
<p>The only enemy of this powerful soul saver, with tendencies in
accord with the times, was, as we have already stated, the
<i>alferez</i>. The women relate a story of how the devil tried one day
to tempt Father Salvi and how the latter caught him, tied him to the
bed post, whipped him with a lash and kept him tied fast for nine days.
Thus he had been able to conquer the devil entirely. As a result, any
one who persisted in being an enemy of the priest was generally
considered a worse man than the devil himself&mdash;an honor which the
<i>alferez</i> alone enjoyed. But he merited this reputation. He had a
wife, an old, powdered and painted Filipino by the name of Do&ntilde;a
Consolaci&oacute;n. The husband and several other people called her by
a different name, but that does not matter. Anyway, the <i>alferez</i>
was accustomed to drown the sorrows of unhappy wedlock by getting as
drunk as a toper. Then, when he was thoroughly intoxicated he would
order his men to drill in the sun, he himself remaining in the shade,
or, perhaps, he would occupy himself in beating his wife.</p>
<p>When her husband was dead drunk, or was snoring away in a siesta,
and Do&ntilde;a Consolaci&oacute;n could not fight with him, then,
wearing a blue flannel shirt, she would seat herself in the window,
with a cigar in her mouth. She had a dislike of children and so from
her window she would scowl and make faces at every girl that passed.
The girls, on the other hand, were afraid of her, and would hurry by at
a quick pace, never daring to raise their eyes or draw a breath. But
say what you may, Do&ntilde;a Consolaci&oacute;n had one great virtue;
she was never known to look into a mirror.</p>
<p>These were the leading people of San Diego.</p>
<p>Toward the west of San Diego, surrounded by rice fields, lies a
village of the dead. A single, narrow path, dusty on dry days, and
navigable by boats when it rains, leads thither from the town. A wooden
gate, and a fence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45</a>]</span>half stone and half bamboo, seem to separate
the cemetery from the people in the town, but not from the goats and
sheep of the parochial priest of the immediate vicinity. These animals
go in and out to rummage among the tombs or to make that solitary place
glad with their presence.</p>
<p>One day a little old man entered the cemetery, his eyes sparkling
and his head uncovered. Upon seeing him, many laughed, while a number
of the women knit their eyebrows in scorn. The old man seemed to take
no notice of these manifestations, but went directly toward a pile of
skulls, knelt down and began to search among the bones. After he had
sorted over with considerable care the skulls one by one, he drew his
eyebrows together, as though he did not find what he was looking for,
moved his head from side to side, looked in all directions, and finally
got up and went over toward a grave-digger.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Eh, there!&rdquo; he shouted to
him.</p>
<p>The grave-digger raised his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know where that beautiful
skull is, the one white as the meat of a cocoanut, with a complete set
of teeth, which I had over there at the foot of the cross under those
leaves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave-digger shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look you!&rdquo; added the little
old man, bringing out of his pocket a handful of silver. &ldquo;I have
more than that, but I will give it to you if you find the skull for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glitter of the coin made the grave-digger reflect. He looked
over in the direction of the bone pile and said: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
over there? No? Then I don&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? When my
debtors pay me, I will give you more,&rdquo; continued the old man.
&ldquo;It was my wife&rsquo;s skull, and if you find it for
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it there. Then I
don&rsquo;t know where it is,&rdquo; repeated the grave-digger with
emphasis. &ldquo;But I will give you another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are like the grave that you
are digging,&rdquo; cried the old man irritably. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know the value of what you lose. For whom is this grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For a dead person, of
course,&rdquo; replied the bad-humored man. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Like a tomb! Like a tomb!&rdquo;
repeated the old man dryly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you throw
out nor what you swallow. Dig! dig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the old man, who was Tasio, the village philosopher, turned
and started toward the gate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the grave-digger had finished his job, and two
little mounds of fresh, red clay were piled on either side of the
grave. He took some betel nut out of his broad-brimmed hat, and began
to chew away, looking with an air of stupidity at everything within his
horizon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=

<h2 class="label">Chapter VIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Ibarra and the Grave-Digger.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Just as the old man was leaving the cemetery, a
carriage stopped at the entrance. It looked as though it had made a
long journey; the horses were sweating and the vehicle was covered with
dust. Ibarra stepped out and was followed by an old servant. He made a
gesture to the driver and then turned down the path into the cemetery.
He was silent and grave.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My sickness and my work have not
permitted me to return, since the day of the funeral,&rdquo; said the
old servant timidly. &ldquo;Captain Tiago said that he would see to it
that a niche was arranged for, but I planted some flowers on the grave
and erected a cross made by my own hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra did not reply.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Right there behind that large
cross, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; continued the servant, making a gesture
toward one of the corners just as they passed through the gate.</p>
<p>Ibarra was so preoccupied with sad thoughts that he did not notice
the astonishment which some of the people in the cemetery manifested
when they saw him enter. Those who were kneeling broke off their
prayers and followed the young man, their eyes full of curiosity.</p>
<p>Ibarra walked along very carefully, and avoided stepping on the
graves, which could be easily distinguished by the sunken ground. In
other times he had walked over them; but to-day he respected them. His
father lay in one of them. On coming to the other side of the large
cross, he stopped and looked in all directions. His companion was
confused and out of countenance. He searched for marks on the ground
but could not find the cross anywhere.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it here?&rdquo; he murmured
between his teeth. &ldquo;No, it is over there, but the earth has been
removed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him with an expression of anguish.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I
remember that there was a stone by the side of the grave. The grave was
a little short, a farm hand had to dig it, as the grave-digger was sick
at the time, but we will ask him what he has done with the
cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned toward the grave-digger, who looked at them with
curiosity. He saluted them, taking off his hat.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Can you tell us which of the
graves over there is the one which had a cross?&rdquo; asked the
servant.</p>
<p>The grave-digger looked toward the place and seemed to reflect.
&ldquo;A large cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, a large cross,&rdquo;
answered the old man with joy, looking significantly at Ibarra, whose
face was somewhat animated.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;An ornamented cross, and fastened
with reeds?&rdquo; repeated the grave-digger, questioning the
servant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it,
yes, yes! Like this, like this,&rdquo; and the servant traced an
outline of a Byzantine cross.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And were there some flowers sown
on the grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Adelphas</i>, <i>sampagas</i>
and pansies! That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; added the servant, delighted, and
offering the grave-digger a cigar. &ldquo;Tell us where the grave is
and where the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave-digger scratched his ear and replied, yawning:
&ldquo;Well, the cross&mdash;I have already burned it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Burned it? and why have you burned
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because the head priest so
ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is the head priest?&rdquo;
asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who? The one who does the
whipping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra put his hand to his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you can at least tell us where
the grave is? You ought to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave-digger smiled. &ldquo;The body is no longer there,&rdquo;
he replied tranquilly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, no longer,&rdquo; the man
added in a joking tone. &ldquo;Only a week ago I buried a woman in its
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; the servant
asked. &ldquo;Why, it is not yet a year since we buried him.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then that is the one, for it was
many months ago that I took up the body. The head priest of the parish
ordered me to do it, in order to bury it in the Chinese cemetery. But
as it was heavy and it was raining that night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man could not finish. He stepped back, half frightened at the
expression on Crisostomo&rsquo;s face. Ibarra made a rush at him, and,
grabbing him by the arm, shook him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo; the
young man asked, in an indescribable tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Honored sir, do not get
angry,&rdquo; he replied, pale and trembling. &ldquo;I did not bury the
body among the Chinese. In my opinion a person might better be a
suicide than be buried among the Chinese. I threw the body into the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra laid both his hands on the man&rsquo;s shoulders and looked
at him for a long time in a terrifying manner. &ldquo;You are only an
unfortunate fellow,&rdquo; he said, at last, and left the place on a
run across bones, graves, and crosses, like a madman.</p>
<p>The grave-digger felt of his arm and murmured: &ldquo;What would
they do with the dead! The head priest whips me with his cane for
having left the body in the cemetery when I was sick. Now this fellow
comes along and nearly breaks my arm for having taken it up. That is
just like the Spaniards! I&rsquo;ll lose my place yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra went on in great haste, keeping his eyes fixed in the
distance. The old servant followed him, crying. Already the sun was
hidden; a large, dark cloud hung over the western horizon; and a dry
wind bent the tops of the trees and made the fields of sugar cane
groan. With hat in hand, he went on. Not one tear dropped from his eye,
not one sigh came from his breast. He hurried on as if he were fleeing
from somebody, or something&mdash;perhaps the shade of his father,
perhaps the tempest which was approaching. He hurried through the town
and headed toward the outlying country, toward that old house which he
had not entered for so many years. The house was surrounded by a wall,
near which many cacti grew, and as he approached they seemed to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>signal to him. The windows seemed to open, the
<i>ilang-ilang</i> joyfully waved its branches, and the doves fluttered
about the little tower on the peak of their garden house.</p>
<p>But the young man did not notice these signs of welcome on his
return to his old home. His eyes were riveted on the form of a priest
who was advancing from the opposite direction. It was the priest of San
Diego, that meditative Franciscan, the enemy of the <i>alferez</i> whom
we have mentioned. The wind was playing with the wide wings of his hat,
and the robe of <i>guingon</i> was flattened out, moulded by the wind
to the outline of his form, marking his slender thighs and bow-legs. In
his right hand he carried a cane. It was the first time that he and
Ibarra had met.</p>
<p>As they approached each other, the young man stopped and looked at
him fixedly. Father Salvi avoided the look and was somewhat distracted.
This vacillation lasted only a moment. Ibarra made a rush toward him,
and stopped the priest from falling only by grasping his shoulder.
Then, in a voice scarcely intelligible, he exclaimed:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What have you done with my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friar Salvi, pale and trembling, as he read the unmistakable
sentiments which were depicted on the young man&rsquo;s face, could not
reply.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What have you done with my
father?&rdquo; he asked again, his voice almost choking him.</p>
<p>The priest, shrinking from the tight grasp of Ibarra&rsquo;s hand,
at last made a great effort and said: &ldquo;You are mistaken. I have
done nothing with your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What? No?&rdquo; continued the
young man, the weight of his hand on the priest&rsquo;s shoulder almost
making him kneel.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, I assure you. It was my
predecessor. It was Father D&aacute;maso&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the young
man, throwing the priest down and giving him a slap in the face. And
leaving Father Salvi, he turned quickly and went toward the house.

<h2 class="main">Adventures of a School Teacher.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Laguna de Bay, surrounded by mountains, sleeps
tranquilly in the stillness of the elements, as if it had not joined
the chorus of the tempest on the night before. As first rays of dawn
appear in the eastern sky and awaken the phosphorescent myriads in the
water, long, grey shadows appear in the dim distance, almost on the
border of the horizon. They are shadows of fishermen&rsquo;s boats at
work drawing in the nets.</p>
<p>Two men, dressed in deep mourning, from a lofty height contemplate
the scene in silence. One is Ibarra, and the other is a young,
meek-looking man with a melancholy countenance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Here is the place!&rdquo; said the
latter. &ldquo;Here is where your father&rsquo;s body was thrown into
the water! The grave-digger brought Lieutenant Guevara and me here and
pointed out the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, with emotion, warmly grasped the young man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You need not thank me!&rdquo;
replied the latter. &ldquo;I owed your father for many favors he did
me. The only thing I could ever do for him was to accompany his body to
the grave. I had come to the town without knowing anybody, without any
recommendations, without a reputation, without money, just as I am now.
Your father protected me, procured a house for me, helped secure
whatever was needed to advance education; he used to come to the school
and distribute pennies among the poor and diligent pupils; he provided
them with books and papers. But that, like all good things, did not
last long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra took off his hat and seemed to pray for a short time. Then he
turned to his companion and said: &ldquo;Did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>you tell
me that my father used to help the poor children<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1574" title="Source: .">?</span> How is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, now they do the best they
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t they come to
school regularly?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, for their shirts are ragged
and they are ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra kept silent for a few moments.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How many pupils have you
now?&rdquo; he asked, with a certain interest.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There are more than two hundred on
the register, but only twenty-five in the class.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How does that happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school teacher sadly smiled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is a long and tedious
story,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I am asking
out of vain curiosity,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, looking seriously at the
distant horizon. &ldquo;I have been meditating a great deal on the
matter, and I believe that it is far better to try to carry out the
ideas of my father than to try to avenge him. His tomb is sacred
Nature; and his enemies were the people and the priest. I can forgive
the people for their ignorance, and as to the priest, I will pardon his
character because I wish to respect the religion which he represents. I
wish to be inspired with the spirit of the one who gave me life, and,
that I may lend my help, I wish to know what are the obstacles here in
the way of education.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The country will bless your
memory, Se&ntilde;or, if you can carry out the beautiful and noble
ideas of your dead father,&rdquo; said the school teacher. &ldquo;You
wish to know what the obstacles are? Very well. We are now in such
circumstances that unless something powerful intervenes, there will
never be any education here. First, because there is no incentive or
stimulus to the children, and, secondly, even when there is an
incentive, lack of means and many prejudices kill it. They say that the
son of a German peasant studies eight years in the town school. Who
would want to spend half of that time in our schools, when the benefits
to be derived are so small? Here the children read, and commit to
memory verses and at times entire books in Spanish, but all without
understanding a single word. What good can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>the sons
of our farmers get out of the school so long as this is the
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you see the evil; have you not
thought out a remedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, poor me!&rdquo; replied the
teacher, shaking his head, &ldquo;a poor teacher cannot alone fight
against prejudices, against existing influences. Above all, I would
need to have a school house, so that I would not, as I do now, have to
teach from the priest&rsquo;s carriage, under the convent. There, when
the children want to read aloud, they naturally disturb the Father, who
at times comes down and very nervous, especially when he has his
attacks, finds fault with the children and insults me. You know very
well that under such conditions no one can do any teaching. The child
does not respect the teacher from that moment when he sees him
mistreated by some one else without maintaining his rights. The
teacher, if he is to be listened to, or if his authority is not to be
doubted, needs prestige, a good name, moral strength, and a certain
amount of freedom. If you will allow me, I will give you an
illustration. I wished to introduce some reforms and they laughed at
me. In order to remedy the evil that I spoke of a moment ago, I tried
to teach the children Spanish, because, not only does the Government
order it, but because it will be a great advantage for them to know the
language. I employed the simplest method, used simple phrases and nouns
without making use of hard rules, with the expectation of teaching them
the grammar as soon as they had learned the language. At the end of
several weeks, almost all the smarter ones in the school understood me
and were able to compose phrases in Castellano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher stopped and seemed to be in doubt. Then, as if he had
made up his mind, he began again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I ought not to be ashamed of the
history of my grievances. If any one had been in my place, he would
have had the same story to tell. As I was saying, I began well. Several
days later the priest, who was then Father D&aacute;maso, sent the
sacristan mayor to tell me that he wanted to see me. As I knew his
character and was afraid to make him wait for me, I went up
immediately, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>saluted him and said good morning to him in
Spanish. As was customary, when I saluted him, I advanced to kiss the
hand which he held out, but just at that moment he withdrew it and,
without replying to me, began to chuckle scoffingly. I was naturally
disconcerted, and it was all done in the presence of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1613" title="Source: sacristian">sacristan</span>
mayor. At the moment, I did not know what to say. I stood and looked at
him while he went on laughing. I had already become impatient and saw
that I was on the point of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1616" title=
"Source: commiting">committing</span> an indiscretion. All of a sudden,
he stopped laughing and added insult to injury. With a cunning air, he
said to me: &lsquo;So it is <i lang="es">buenos dias</i>, eh? <i lang=
"es">buenos dias</i>, ha, ha! How funny! Why, you know how to speak
Spanish, do you?&rsquo; And then he continued his laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra could not keep back his smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You laugh,&rdquo; replied the
teacher, also smiling. &ldquo;I confess that I did not feel like
smiling at that time. I felt the blood rush to my head, and a
thunderbolt seemed to dazzle my brain. I saw the priest far off, very
far from me. I started toward him to reply. The sacristan mayor
interposed and said very seriously, in Tagalog: &lsquo;You want to stop
wearing borrowed clothes. Be content to speak in your own language and
do not spoil Spanish, which is not meant for you. You have heard about
Ciruela? Well, Ciruela was a teacher who did not know how to read, but
he taught school.&rsquo; I wanted to detain him for a moment, but he
went quickly into his room and closed the door violently. What was I to
do? In order to collect my salary I have to have the approval of the
priest on my bill, and have to make a journey to the capital of the
province. What could I do to him&mdash;the moral, political and civil
authority of the town, sustained by his corporation, feared by the
Government, rich, powerful, always consulting, advising, listening,
believing and attending to everything&mdash;what could I do to him? If
he insulted me, I had to keep my mouth closed. If I talked back, he
would throw me out of work, spoiling my career. And what good would it
do&mdash;education? On the contrary, everybody would take up the
priest&rsquo;s side of the matter; they would criticise <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>me, they
would call me vain, proud, arrogant, a poor Christian, poorly educated,
and when not this, they would call me an anti-Spaniard and an agitator.
The school teacher should have no authority. He should only be lazy,
humble, and resigned to his low position. May God pardon me if I do not
speak conscientiously and truthfully, but I was born in this country, I
have to live, I have a mother to support and I have to be resigned to
my lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And have you continued to be
discouraged on account of this trouble? Have you attempted nothing
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Would to God that it had ended
there!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Would to God that that had been the
end of my misfortunes. The truth is that from that day I began to take
a dislike to my profession. Every day the school brought to my mind my
disgrace and made every hour a bitter one for me. But what could I do?
I could not disappoint my mother. I had to tell her that the three
years of sacrifices which she had made for me in order that I might
learn the profession now made me happy. I had to make her believe that
the profession was a most honorable one, that the work was most
pleasant, that the road was strewn with flowers and that the
fulfillment of my duty produced nothing but friendships. If I had told
her the contrary, I myself would still be as unhappy and would only
make another unhappy, which was not only useless but a sin. So, I kept
at my work and tried not to be discouraged. I tried to fight it
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school teacher made a short pause and then began again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know that the books in most of
the schools are in Spanish, excepting the Tagalog catechism, which
varies according to the corporation which appoints the priest of the
parish. The books generally used in the school are novenaries, the
&lsquo;Doxology&rsquo; and Father Astete&rsquo;s catechism, which are
no more edifying than the books of heretics. On account of the fact
that it was impossible to teach the children Spanish, as I wanted to
do, and owing to the fact that I could not translate so many books into
the native language, I decided to try to substitute <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>for them
gradually, short verses, extracts from the best Tagalog books, such as
the &lsquo;Treatise on Urbanity&rsquo; by Hortensio y Feliza, and some
of the little pamphlets on agriculture. Sometimes I myself translated
small works, such as the &lsquo;History of the Philippines,&rsquo; by
Father Barranera, and afterward dictated to the pupils for their note
books, adding at times some of my own observations. As I had no maps to
teach them geography, I copied one of those of the province which I saw
in the capital, and with this reproduction and, by the aid of the tiles
on the floor, I was able to give them some ideas about the country. The
new priest sent for me. Although he did not reprimand me severely, he
told me, however, that my first duty was to teach religion, and that
before I began to teach any such things I must prove by an examination
that all the children knew by heart the &lsquo;Mysteries,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Doxology,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Catechism of the Christian
Doctrine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So, in the meantime, I am
endeavoring to convert the children into parrots so that they will know
by heart all of these things of which they do not understand a single
word. Many of the pupils already know the &lsquo;Mysteries&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Doxology,&rsquo; but I fear that I am making Father
Astete&rsquo;s efforts useless, inasmuch as my pupils do not even
distinguish between the questions and the answers, or what either of
them signifies. Thus we shall die and thus shall do those who are yet
to be born; yet in Europe they talk about Progress!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us not be so
pessimistic,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, rising to his feet. &ldquo;The
<i>teniente mayor</i> has invited me to attend a town meeting to be
held in the tribunal. Who knows but that some plan for improvement may
there be adopted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school teacher arose to go, shaking his head in token of doubt.

<h2 class="label">Chapter X.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Lights and Shadows.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The people of the town have made their preparation for
the festival in honor of the patron saint, San Diego, and are gossiping
about it, and about the arrival of Maria Clara, accompanied by her aunt
Isabel. They rejoiced over it, because they liked her, and admired her
beauty very much. They also rejoiced in the change it had made in the
priest, Father Salvi. &ldquo;He is often absent-minded during the holy
services,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;He scarcely speaks with us, and he
plainly grows more thin and taciturn.&rdquo; His cook saw this
constantly and complained of the little honor that he did his dishes.
But what most excited the wonder of the people were the two lights
which one could see shining in the convent during the night, while
Father Salvi was visiting at the house of Maria Clara! The old dames
crossed themselves and kept on gossiping.</p>
<p>Juan Crisostomo Ibarra had telegraphed from the capital of the
province his compliments to Aunt Isabel and her niece, but he had not
explained his absence. Many thought that he had been arrested for
assaulting Father Salvi on the afternoon of &ldquo;All Saint&rsquo;s
Day.&rdquo; But the comments increased still more when, on the
afternoon of the third day, they saw Ibarra get out of a carriage in
front of the little house of his betrothed, and courteously salute the
priest, who was also making his way thither.</p>
<p>If we go to Maria Clara&rsquo;s house, we will find it like a little
nest among orange and <i>ilang-ilang</i> trees, surrounded by flowers
and vines which creep up on bamboo sticks and wires, diffusing their
delicious perfume. The rich fragrance of the <i>ilang-ilang</i> reaches
even to the window which looks out on the lake. Here sit the two young
lovers. Ibarra was saying to Maria Clara:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To-morrow, before the first ray of
morning, your desire shall be fulfilled. To-night, I shall arrange all
so that nothing will be lacking.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then I will write to my friends,
so that they may come along. Arrange it so that the priest cannot
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because he seems to be watching
me. His deep and sombre eyes pain me. When he fixes them upon me, they
frighten me. He speaks to me of extraordinary things, so
incomprehensible, so strange. He asked me once if I had not dreamed
about my mother&rsquo;s letters. I believe he is half crazy. My friend
Sinang, and Andeng, my foster sister, say that he is a little out of
his head, for he neither eats nor bathes, and he lives entirely in the
darkness. Don&rsquo;t have him come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We cannot but invite him,&rdquo;
replied Ibarra. &ldquo;The customs of the country require it. He is the
priest of your house and, besides, he has conducted himself nobly
toward me. When the <i>Alcalde</i> consulted him on the business of
which I have spoken to you, he had nothing but praises for me and did
not pretend to offer the slightest obstacle. But I see that you are
serious. I shall take care that he does not accompany us in the
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light steps were heard. They were those of the priest, who was
approaching with a forced smile on his lips. They began to talk of
different subjects, about the weather, the town and the festival. Maria
Clara devised an excuse and went out.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And while we are speaking about
festivals,&rdquo; said Ibarra, &ldquo;allow me to invite you to the one
which we are going to celebrate to-morrow. It is going to be a country
picnic, which we and our friends are planning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And where will it be
held?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The girls want to hold it near the
brook in the woods, near the <i>balit&icirc;</i> tree. So we will have
to get up early to reach the place before the sun gets hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest reflected, and a moment later replied: &ldquo;The
invitation is very tempting, and I accept it in order to prove that I
hold no grudge against you for what has happened in the past. But I
will have to be a little late, as I must fulfill my religious duties
first. How happy to be like you, entirely free and
independent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Ibarra took his leave in order to arrange for
the picnic on the following day. It was already quite dark when he left
the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=

<h2 class="main">The Fishing Party.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The stars were still shining in the sapphire heavens,
and the birds were sleeping on the branches of the trees, when a jolly
little party, by the light from the pitch torches, wandered through the
streets of the town toward the lake.</p>
<p>Five young maidens, clinging to each other&rsquo;s hands or belts,
tripped along briskly. Behind them came several elderly women and a
number of servants gracefully carrying on their heads baskets filled
with provisions and various dishes for the picnic. On seeing their
joyful faces, with their youthful smiles, their beautiful black hair as
it floated in the breeze, and the wide folds of their pretty dresses,
you would have taken them for goddesses of the night and would have
thought that they were fleeing from day&mdash;if perchance you had not
already known that it was Maria Clara and her four friends: jolly
Sinang; her cousin, the serious Victoria; beautiful Iday; and the
pensive Neneng, pretty, modest and timid.</p>
<p>They were talking with animation; they laughed; pinched each other;
whispered in each other&rsquo;s ears and then burst out in shouts of
merriment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You girls will wake up everybody
in town. Don&rsquo;t you know that people are still asleep?&rdquo; said
Aunt Isabel, reprimanding them. &ldquo;When we were young, we
didn&rsquo;t make such a noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t get up as
early as we do, nor were the old men such great sleepers in your
day,&rdquo; replied little Sinang.</p>
<p>They were quiet for a moment and were trying to talk in a low voice,
but they quickly forgot themselves and were again filling the streets
with their youthful laughter and melodious voices. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>Several young fellows were coming down the street, lighting their
way with large bamboo torches. They were marching along almost
noiselessly to the tune of a guitar.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That guitar sounds as though some
beggar were playing it,&rdquo; said Sinang, laughing. But when the
young fellows caught up with the rest of the party, the girls suddenly
became as quiet and as serious as though they never had learned how to
laugh. The young men, however, chatted away, saluted the ladies,
laughed and smiled and asked half a dozen questions without giving the
girls time to answer any one of them.</p>
<p>The two large <i>bancas</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1726src"
href="#xd21e1726" name="xd21e1726src">1</a> which had been secured to
transport the picnic party to the fishing grounds, were fastened
together and picturesquely adorned with wreaths and garlands of flowers
and a large number of vari-colored candles. Paper lanterns hung from
the improvised covering of the <i>bancas</i>. Alternately with these
were roses, pinks and baskets of fruits such as pineapples,
<i>kasuys</i>, bananas, <i>guayabas</i> and <i>lanzones</i>. Ibarra had
brought his carpets, blankets and rugs and arranged comfortable seats
for the ladies. The poles and paddles used to propel the <i>bancas</i>
had also been ornamented. In the better <i>banca</i> were a harp,
guitars, accordeons, and a buffalo horn; while, in the other boat, a
little fire had been lighted in an improvised stove in order that tea,
coffee and <i>salabat</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1750src" href=
"#xd21e1750" name="xd21e1750src">2</a> might be prepared for the light
breakfast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The women sit here; the men,
there,&rdquo; said the mothers on stepping into the <i>banca</i>.
&ldquo;Sit still and don&rsquo;t move, or we will be
capsized.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cross yourselves before we
start,&rdquo; said Aunt Isabel, as she traced the form of a cross on
her breast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And are we to be here all by
ourselves,&rdquo; asked Sinang, on seeing how the girls had been
separated from the young men, by the assignment of the seats. Then
making a grimace she asked again, &ldquo;Are we going to be all alone?
<i>Aray!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This <i>aray</i> was caused by a little pinch which her mother had
given her on the arm in the way of a reprimand for her complaint.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>bancas</i> were now putting off slowly from the shore. The
light from the torches and Japanese lanterns was reflected in the
water, for the lake was as smooth as a mirror. In the far eastern
horizon could be seen the first rosy tints of the approaching dawn.</p>
<p>Everything was very quiet. The young women, in consequence of the
separation from the young men, seemed to be absorbed in meditation.</p>
<p>As the water was smooth as glass and the bamboo weirs where the fish
were to be found were not far off, and, it was still early, it was
decided that all should stop paddling and take breakfast. The lights
were put out, for the day had dawned and preparations were made for
<i>desayuno</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1784src" href="#xd21e1784"
name="xd21e1784src">3</a></p>
<p>The entire party became jolly as they breathed in the light breeze
that had come up. Even the women, so full of presentiments a few
moments ago, were now laughing and joking among themselves.</p>
<p>One young man alone of all the party remained silent. He was the
pilot, an athletic-looking fellow, and interesting on account of his
large, sad eyes and the severe lines of his lips. His long, black hair
fell gracefully over his powerful neck. He wore a shirt of coarse dark
cloth, through which his powerful muscles could be plainly seen as he
manipulated with his strong arms the wide, heavy paddle as if it were
only a pen. This paddle served both to propel and to steer the
<i>bancas</i>.</p>
<p>More than once he was embarrassed when he caught Maria Clara looking
at him. Then he would turn his eyes quickly to some other direction and
look far off toward the mountain, or the shore of the lake. The young
maiden pitied him in his solitude and offered him some biscuits. The
pilot looked at her with surprise, but only for a moment. He took the
biscuits, thanked her very briefly and in a voice scarcely audible.</p>
<p>No one else took any notice of him. The happy laughter and jolly
conversation of the young men did not cause him to relax a single
muscle of his face. Not even Sinang, with all her jollity, had any
effect on him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said Aunt
Isabel to the boatman&rsquo;s son, who had made ready his net and was
just about to go up on the <i>baklad</i> to take out the fish from the
little enclosure at the end of the weir. &ldquo;We must have everything
ready, so that the fish may pass directly from the water to the
pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andeng, the pretty foster sister of Maria Clara, despite her clear
complexion and laughing face, had the reputation of being a good cook.
She prepared the rice, tomatoes, and <i>camias</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1810src" href="#xd21e1810" name="xd21e1810src">4</a> while
some of the young men tried to aid or bother her, perhaps in order to
win her good will. The other girls were busy cleaning and making ready
the lettuce, cabbage and peas, and cutting up paayap in pieces about
the size of a cigarette.</p>
<p>Finally Andeng announced that the kettle was ready to receive its
guests&mdash;the fish.</p>
<p>The fisherman&rsquo;s son went up on top of the rack at the end of
the weir. He took a position at the narrow entrance, over which might
have been written: &ldquo;All who enter here leave hope behind,&rdquo;
if indeed the unfortunate fish would know how to read and understand
it, for a fish who enters never gets out except to die. The rack is
almost circular in form and about a meter in diameter, and is so
arranged that a man can stand on top of one end of it and thus take out
the fish with his net.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There, it wouldn&rsquo;t tire me a
bit to fish that way,&rdquo; said Sinang, quite joyful.</p>
<p>All were watching attentively. Already some of them in their vivid
imaginations thought they could see the fish wiggling their tails and
trying to get out of the little net, their scales shining in the bright
sun. However, the young man failed to catch a single fish in his first
attempt.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It ought to be full of
fish,&rdquo; said Albino, in a low voice. &ldquo;It is more than five
days since we visited the place last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fisherman drew out his net a second time, but not a fish was
there in it. The water, as it trickled through the meshes of the net in
countless drops which reflected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>the rays of the sun, seemed to
laugh in silvery tones. An &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; of surprise, disgust, and
disappointment escaped from the lips of all.</p>
<p>The young fellow repeated the same operation, but with a similar
result.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand your
business!&rdquo; said Albino to him as he stepped up on the rack and
took the net from the hands of the youngster. &ldquo;Now you will see!
Andeng, open up the kettle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Albino did not understand his business, either. The net came up
empty as before. All began to laugh.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any noise,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;or the fish will hear it and will keep from being
caught. This net must have a hole in it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But every mesh in the net was perfect.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me take it!&rdquo; said Leon,
Iday&rsquo;s lover, to Albino.</p>
<p>Leon first made sure that the enclosure was in good condition and
then examined the net carefully and satisfied himself that there was
nothing wrong with it. He then asked: &ldquo;Are you sure that no one
has been out here for five days?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We are sure! The last time any one
was out here was on All Saints&rsquo; Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, then, I am going to bring
out something this time, unless the lake is bewitched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leon lowered the net by its bamboo handle into the water, but a look
of surprise was painted on his face. In silence he looked toward the
neighboring mountain and continued moving the handle of the net from
one side to the other. Finally, without taking the net out of the
water, he murmured in a low voice: &ldquo;An alligator.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;An alligator!&rdquo; exclaimed
half a dozen voices, and the word was repeated again while all stood
frightened and stupefied.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; they
asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I say that there is an alligator
caught in the rack,&rdquo; said Leon, and sticking the handle of the
net into the water again he continued: &ldquo;Do you hear that sound?
That is not sand, it is hard skin, the back of the alligator. Do you
see how he wiggles the bamboo pickets in the rack? He is struggling
hard but he cannot do anything. Wait. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>He is a large fellow; his
body measures a palm or more in width.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What shall be done?&rdquo; was the
question.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Catch him,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> And who will
catch him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody offered to dive down to the bottom of the rack. The water was
very deep.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We ought to tie him to our
<i>banca</i> and drag him along in triumph,&rdquo; said Sinang.
&ldquo;The idea of his eating the fish which we ought to
have!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have never seen to this day a
live alligator,&rdquo; said Maria Clara.</p>
<p>The pilot rose to his feet, took a long rope and went up cautiously
to the platform on the top of the rack. Leon gave up his position to
him.</p>
<p>With the exception of Maria Clara, none up till now had paid any
attention to him. Now every one was admiring his fine stature.</p>
<p>To the great surprise of all and in spite of all their cries, the
pilot leaped into the enclosure.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take this knife!&rdquo; shouted
Crisostomo, drawing out a wide-bladed Toledo knife.</p>
<p>But already a thousand little bubbles were rising to the surface of
the water, and all that was going on in the depths below was wrapped in
mystery.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s, Maria y
Jos&eacute;!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the women. &ldquo;We are going to
have a misfortune. <i>Jes&uacute;s, Maria y Jos&eacute;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,
se&ntilde;oras,&rdquo; said the old boatman. &ldquo;If there is any one
in this province who can do it, it is that fellow who has just gone
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; they
asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We call him &lsquo;The
Pilot&rsquo;; he is the best I have ever seen, only he does not like
his profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was being stirred violently, and it seemed that a fierce
fight was being waged in the depths of the lake. The sides of the
enclosure swayed to and fro, while the water seemed to be swirled by a
dozen currents. All held their breath. Ibarra grasped tightly the
handle of his sharp knife.</p>
<p>The fight seemed to be at an end. The head of the young man rose to
the surface of the water, and the sight <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>was greeted by joyful
shouts from all. The eyes of the women were full of tears.</p>
<p>The pilot crawled up on the platform carrying in his hand the end of
the rope, and as soon as he was able pulled on it.</p>
<p>The monster appeared on top of the water. He had the rope tied twice
around his neck, and once behind his forelegs. He was a large fellow,
as Leon had already announced. He was beautifully colored and green
moss was growing on his back. He bellowed like an ox, struck his tail
against the sides of the enclosure, snapped at them, and opened his
black, frightful-looking mouth, showing his long teeth.</p>
<p>The pilot, unassisted, raised him up out of the water. No one
offered to help him. Just as soon as the animal was out of the water
and placed on the platform, the pilot put his foot on his back. Then,
closing the animal&rsquo;s massive jaws, he tried to tie his big snout
tight with the rope. The reptile made a last effort, doubled up his
body, struck the floor of the platform with his powerful tail and,
breaking loose, made a leap into the water of the lake, on the other
side of the weir, at the same time dragging with him his captor. It
seemed that the pilot would be a dead man. A cry of horror went up from
all.</p>
<p>Like a flash of lightning, another body leaped into the water. So
quickly was it done that they had scarcely time to see that it was
Ibarra. Maria Clara did not faint, simply because the Filipinos do not
know how to faint.</p>
<p>They all saw the water become colored, and tinged with blood. The
young fisherman leaped to the bottom with his bolo in his hand; his
father followed him. But, scarcely had they disappeared, when they saw
Crisostomo and the pilot reappear, clinging to the body of the reptile.
The monster&rsquo;s white belly was slashed, while in his throat the
knife still stuck like a nail.</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the joy that came over the party at the
sight; all arms were extended to help them out of the water. The old
women were half crazed with joy, and laughed and prayed. Andeng forgot
that her kettle had been boiling three different times; now it was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>leaking and had put out the fire. The only one who
could not speak was Maria Clara.</p>
<p>Ibarra was unhurt. The pilot had a slight scratch on his arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I owe you my life!&rdquo; said he
to Ibarra as the latter wrapped himself up in the shawls and blankets.
The voice of the pilot had a ring of sincerity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are too bold,&rdquo; replied
Ibarra. &ldquo;Another time you must not tempt God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you had never come back!&rdquo;
exclaimed Maria, pale and trembling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I had never come back and you
had followed after me,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;I would
have been with all my family in the bottom of the lake.&rdquo; Ibarra
was thinking that in those depths lay the remains of his father.</p>
<p>The mothers of the girls did not want to go to the other
<i>baklad</i> or weir. They preferred to go back home happy, for the
day had commenced with a bad omen and they feared that they would
suffer many misfortunes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is all because we have not
heard mass,&rdquo; sighed one of them.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But what misfortune have we had,
se&ntilde;oras?&rdquo; asked Ibarra. &ldquo;The alligator was the
unfortunate one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That goes to show,&rdquo;
concluded Albino, &ldquo;that, in all his fishing life, this reptile
has never heard mass. I never saw him, I am sure, among the other
reptiles who frequent the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>bancas</i> were turned toward the other fish rack, and it was
necessary for Andeng to get the water boiling again.</p>
<p>The day was advancing; a breeze was blowing; little waves were
stirred up on the water, and rippled around the alligator. The music
began again. Iday was playing the harp, while the young men were
playing the accordeons and guitars with more or less skill. But the one
who played best was Albino.</p>
<p>The other weir was visited with an entire lack of confidence. Many
of the party expected to find there the mate to the alligator, but
Nature fooled them and every time that the net was lowered it was
brought up full of fish. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=
"#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>They then headed for the shore of the lake, where is situated the
forest of trees centuries old, owned by Ibarra. There in the shade and
near the crystal brook the party were to take their breakfast among the
flowers or under improvised tents. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"

<h2 class="label">Chapter XII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">In the Woods.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Very early that morning Father Salv&iacute; had said
mass, cleaning, according to his custom, a dozen dirty souls in a few
minutes. The reading of a few letters, which had arrived well sealed
with wax, seemed to cause the worthy curate to lose his appetite, for
he allowed his chocolate to get cold.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Father is ill,&rdquo; said the
cook as he prepared another cup. &ldquo;It is several days since he has
eaten anything; of six dishes which I put on the table for him, he has
not touched two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It must be that he does not sleep
well,&rdquo; replied the servant. &ldquo;He has nightmare since he
changed his bedroom. Every day his eyes are sinking deeper, he grows
gradually thinner, and is very yellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it was a pitiful sight to behold Father
Salv&iacute;. He did not care to touch his second cup of chocolate, nor
to taste the Cebu cakes. He walked pensively to and fro in the spacious
<i>sala</i>, crumpling between his bony fingers some letters which he
would read from time to time. Finally, he called for his carriage, got
ready and ordered the coachman to take him to the woods where the
picnic was to be held. Arriving at the place, Father Salv&iacute;
dismissed the carriage and all alone, entered the forest.</p>
<p>A shady but difficult path runs through the thicket and leads to the
brook which is formed by the hot springs so plentiful at the base of
Mount Makiling.</p>
<p>For some time, Father Salv&iacute; was wandering among the thick
underbrush, here trying to evade the thorns which entangled his habit
of <i>guingon</i> as if to detain him; there trying to step over the
roots of the trees which stuck up through the ground and made the
inexperienced traveler <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>stumble again and again. Suddenly he stopped.
Mirthful laughter and the sound of young voices reached his ears. The
voices and the laughter seemed to come from the direction of the brook
and each time seemed to be coming nearer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am going to see if I can find a
heron&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; said a voice, beautiful and sweet, and at
once recognized by the curate. &ldquo;You know they say that if a
person possesses one of those nests he can make himself invisible to
everybody. How I would like to see <i>him</i> and not have him see me!
I could follow him everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; hid behind the thick trunk of an old tree and
listened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is to say, you want to do
with him what the curate does with you: watch him everywhere?&rdquo;
replied the merry voice. &ldquo;Be careful, for jealousy makes one grow
thin and the eyes sink in.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, no. It is not jealousy, it is
pure curiosity,&rdquo; replied the silvery voice, while the other
repeated, &ldquo;yes, yes, jealousy; that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;
And then she broke out in a merry chuckle.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I were jealous of <i>him</i> I
would not use the heron&rsquo;s nest to make myself invisible to him,
but would make him invisible to everybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But then you yourself would not be
able to see him and you would not want that to happen. The best thing
to do, if we find a heron&rsquo;s nest is to give it to the priest.
Then he could watch us as much as he pleased, and we would not be
troubled with the sight of him. What do you think of the
idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe in the
story about the heron&rsquo;s nests, anyway,&rdquo; replied one.
&ldquo;But if I were really jealous I would know how to keep watch of a
person and make myself invisible....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And how? How would you do it?
Perhaps you would do as Sister Listener does in the convent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reference to days passed in the convent provoked a jolly laugh
all around.</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; saw from his hiding-place Maria Clara, Victoria,
and Sinang, wading in the stream. All three were looking into the
water, which was like a mirror, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>search of the heron&rsquo;s
nest. They were getting wet up to their knees, the wide folds of their
bathing skirts allowing one to guess how graceful were the curves of
their limbs. They were wearing their hair loose and their arms were
bare. Striped, bright-colored bodices covered their breasts. The three
lasses, at the same time that they were hunting for that which did not
exist, collected flowers and plants which were growing on the banks of
the stream.</p>
<p>The religious Acteon, pale and immovable, stood gazing upon Maria
Clara, that chaste Diana. The eyes which shone in those dark orbits
never tired of admiring those white and beautiful arms, that pretty,
round neck, those tiny and rosy feet as they played in the water. As he
contemplated all this, strange feelings were awakened in his breast,
new dreams took possession of his burning mind.</p>
<p>The three pretty forms disappeared in a thick growth of bamboo
behind a bend in the stream, but their cruel allusions could still be
heard by the curate. Intoxicated with the strange ideas in his head,
staggering, and covered with perspiration, Father Salv&iacute; left his
hiding-place and looked about him in all directions with staring eyes.
He stood immovable, in doubt. He took a few steps as if to follow the
young women, but he turned about, and walked along the bank of the
stream in order to find the rest of the picnic party.</p>
<p>Some distance ahead, in the middle of the stream, he could see a
bathing place well enclosed by bamboo. He could hear, merry laughter
and feminine accents coming from that direction. Still further down the
stream he could see a bamboo bridge and some men in bathing. In the
meantime, a multitude of servants were bustling about the improvised
fireplaces, some engaged in plucking chickens, others in washing rice
and roasting pig. And there on the opposite bank, in a clearing which
had been made, were a number of men and women under a tent. The tent
had been made by hanging canvas from the limbs of some of the old trees
and by erecting a few poles. There in the group was the <i>alferez</i>,
the <i>teniente mayor</i>, the coadjutor, the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>,
the school teacher, a number, of past captains and lieutenants,
including even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>Captain Basilio, who was Sinang&rsquo;s father,
and the former rival of the deceased Don Rafael. Ibarra had said to
him: &ldquo;The mere fact that we are parties to a law-suit does not
mean that we have to be enemies.&rdquo; So it was that the celebrated
orator of the conservative party had accepted the invitation to the
picnic with enthusiasm, and had even brought along three turkeys and
put his servants at the disposition of the young man.</p>
<p>The parish priest was received with respect and deference by all,
even by the <i>alferez</i>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But where did Your Reverence come
from?&rdquo; some one asked on seeing his face full of scratches, and
his habit covered with leaves and pieces of dried branches. &ldquo;Has
Your Reverence fallen down?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, I lost my way,&rdquo; replied
Father Salv&iacute;, looking down and examining his clothes.</p>
<p>Bottles of lemonade were opened, green cocoanuts were cut in two so
that those who were coming out of the bath might have the refreshing
milk to drink and the delicate meat to eat. The young women in addition
received rosaries of <i>sampagas</i> interwoven with roses and
<i>ilang-ilang</i>, which gave a beautiful fragrance to their loose
hair. Some were sitting or lying in hammocks which had been hung from
the branches of the trees; others were entertaining themselves in a
game that was going on around a large, flat stone. Playing cards,
checkers, dice and many other games were in progress.</p>
<p>They showed the alligator to the curate, but he seemed absorbed and
paid no attention until they mentioned the fact that the wide wound in
the animal&rsquo;s neck had been made by Ibarra. Then, too, the pilot,
the principal figure in the incident, had disappeared and could not be
found anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally Maria Clara came out of the bath, accompanied by her
friends, fresh as a rose when first it blooms, and when the dew on its
divine petals glistens like diamonds. Her first smile was for Ibarra;
and her first frown for Father Salv&iacute;. The latter noticed this,
but he did not even sigh.</p>
<p>It was now time to eat. The curate, the coadjutor, the
<i>alferez</i>, the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>, and some of the captains,
together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>with the <i>tenente mayor</i> sat down at the
table over which Ibarra presided. The mothers of the girls did not
allow any one to eat at the table with their charges.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know anything yet,
Se&ntilde;or Alferez, about the criminal who assaulted Father
D&aacute;maso?&rdquo; asked Father Salv&iacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;About what criminal,
Father?&rdquo; asked the <i>alferez</i>, looking at the parish priest
through his empty wine glass.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;About whom could it be? About the
one who, day before yesterday, struck Father D&aacute;maso, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Struck Father
D&aacute;maso?&rdquo; asked a number of voices.</p>
<p>The coadjutor was seen to smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes; and Father D&aacute;maso is
now in bed. It is believed that the culprit was that same Elias who
once threw you into a mud-hole, Se&ntilde;or Alferez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> colored up a little, either from shame or too
much wine.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I thought that you were interested
in the affair,&rdquo; continued Father Salv&iacute;, with a little
jeering in his manner.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> bit his lips and mumbled out a silly excuse.</p>
<p>The meal ended and, while tea and coffee were being served, the
young and old distributed themselves about in various groups. Some
picked up playing cards and others dice, but the young women, anxious
to know the future, preferred to try their luck with the wheel of
fortune.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo;
shouted Captain Basilio, who was a little bit jolly. &ldquo;We have a
law-suit that has been pending for fifteen years, and there isn&rsquo;t
a judge in the Supreme Court in Manila who can decide it. Let us see if
we can settle it on the chess board. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The game of chess began with much solemnity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If the game is a draw,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, &ldquo;it is understood that the suit is off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the middle of the game, Ibarra received a telegram which made
his eyes glisten and his face grow pale. He put it in his pocket-book,
not, however, without directing a glance at the group of young women
who continued with much laughter to play the wheel of fortune.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Check to the king!&rdquo; said the
young man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>Captain Basilio had no other resort than to hide him behind the
queen.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Check to the queen!&rdquo; said
Ibarra, threatening it with his rook, which was defended by a pawn.</p>
<p>Not being able to cover the queen, nor to retire it on account of
the fact that the king was behind it, Captain Basilio asked permission
to study the situation a little.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Certainly, with much
pleasure,&rdquo; replied Ibarra. &ldquo;I will take advantage of the
opportunity, for I have something to say to some of the members of that
group over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And rising to his feet, he gave his opponent half an hour to study
it out.</p>
<p>Iday held in her hands the strip of cardboard on which was written
forty-eight questions, while Albino held the book which contained the
answers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie! It&rsquo;s not
so! It lies!&rdquo; cried Sinang, half in tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the matter with
you?&rdquo; asked Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Just imagine it: I asked the
question &lsquo;When will I have some sense?&rsquo; I threw the dice
and he, this all-night-watching priest (Albino, the ex-seminary
student) reads from the book: &lsquo;When the frogs grow hairs.&rsquo;
What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sinang made a face at the former religious student, who was
still laughing heartily.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who told you to ask such a
question?&rdquo; said her cousin Victoria. &ldquo;Any one who asks such
a question deserves just such an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You ask a question!&rdquo; said
they all to Ibarra. &ldquo;We have agreed that the one who receives the
best answer shall receive a gift from the others. We have all asked our
questions already.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And who has received the best
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria Clara, Maria Clara!&rdquo;
replied Sinang. &ldquo;We made her ask the question whether you loved
her or not: &lsquo;Is your lover faithful and constant,&rsquo; and the
book replied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Maria Clara colored up, and, putting her hands over
Sinang&rsquo;s mouth, did not allow her to finish what she had to say.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, let me try it,&rdquo; said
Crisostomo, smiling.</p>
<p>He asked the question: &ldquo;Will I succeed in my present
undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are going to get a bad
answer,&rdquo; exclaimed Sinang.</p>
<p>Ibarra threw the dice, and noting the number, they looked for the
page in the little book with the corresponding answer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dreams are only dreams,&rdquo;
read Albino.</p>
<p>Ibarra took out his pocket-book and opened it trembling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This time your book has
lied,&rdquo; he said, full of joy. &ldquo;Read this!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Plan for school house approved;
other matter decided in your favor.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; they
all asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you not tell me that the one
who received the best answer was to get a present?&rdquo; the young man
asked, his voice trembling with emotion while he carefully divided the
paper into two parts.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, then! This is my
gift,&rdquo; he said handing half of the telegram to Maria Clara.
&ldquo;I am going to have a school house for boys and girls erected in
the town. This school house will be my gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And this other piece: what does
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I will give that to the one who
has obtained the worst answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then that is for me!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sinang.</p>
<p>Ibarra gave her the piece of paper and quickly went off.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what does this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the happy young man was already far away from the little group
and he did not reply. He had gone to finish the game of chess.</p>
<p>After making the present to his betrothed, Ibarra was so happy that
he began to play without stopping to think or even examining carefully
the position of the chess. As a result, although Captain Basilio had
defended himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>only by the greatest effort, the young man made so
many mistakes that the game resulted in a draw.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We end the suit, we end the
suit!&rdquo; said Captain Basilio, happy over his success.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, we declare it off,&rdquo;
repeated the young man, &ldquo;whatever decision the judges may have
been able to reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each grasped the hand of the other and shook it with effusion.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while those present were celebrating the ending of
the law-suit, of which both had long been tired, four Civil Guards and
a sergeant suddenly arrived on the scene. They were all armed and had
their bayonets fixed, a fact which naturally disturbed the merriment
and brought fright into the circle of women.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let everybody be quiet!&rdquo;
cried the sergeant. &ldquo;Whoever moves will be shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this gruff boast, Ibarra rose to his feet and approached
the sergeant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That you give up at once the
criminal named Elias who acted as pilot for your party this
morning,&rdquo; he replied, in a threatening tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A criminal? The pilot? You must be
mistaken!&rdquo; replied Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, sir; that Elias is now accused
of another crime, of having laid his hands on a
priest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! And is the pilot the
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is the same one, so we are
told. You are allowing people of bad reputation to attend your
festivals, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him from head to foot and replied with supreme
contempt: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to account to you for my actions.
At our festivals everybody is well received, and you yourself, if you
had come, would have been given a seat at the table, the same as the
<i>alferez</i> who was here among us two hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, Ibarra turned his back to him. The sergeant bit his
mustache and ordered his men to search everywhere among the trees for
the pilot, whose description he had on a piece of paper. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>Don Filipo said to him: &ldquo;Take note that this description
corresponds to that of nine-tenths of the natives. Take care that you
do not make a mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the soldiers returned, saying that they had not been able to
discover either a <i>banca</i>, or a man that aroused their suspicion.
The sergeant murmured a few indistinct words and then marched off.</p>
<p>Soon the people became jolly again, but questions, wonder and
comments were without end.</p>
<p>So the afternoon passed and the hour for departure arrived. Just as
the sun was dropping below the horizon they left the woods. The trees
seemed sad and all the surroundings seemed to bid them farewell and
say: &ldquo;Good-bye, happy youth; good-bye, dream of a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a little later, by the light of glowing torches of bamboo and
with the music of guitars, we leave them on the road toward the town.

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter XIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">In the House of Tasio.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the morning of the following day, Juan Crisostomo
Ibarra, after visiting his estates, went to the house of Tasio, the
philosopher, his father&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>Quiet reigned in the old man&rsquo;s garden. The swallows were
flying about the gables of the house, but they were making scarcely a
sound. The windows were covered with vines which clung to the old,
moss-covered wall and made the house appear all the more solitary and
quiet. Ibarra tied his horse to a post and, walking almost on tip-toes,
crossed the clean and well-cultivated garden. He went up the stairs
and, as the door was open, walked in. An old man leaned over a book in
which he seemed to be writing. On the walls of the room were
collections of insects and leaves, maps, and some shelves of books and
manuscripts.</p>
<p>Tasio was so absorbed in his work that he did not notice the arrival
of the youth. The latter, not wishing to disturb the philosopher, tried
to retire from the place, but the old man, looking up, said:
&ldquo;What? Are you here?&rdquo; and showed no little surprise in his
look.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; replied Ibarra,
&ldquo;I see that you are very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As a matter of fact I was writing
a little, but it is not urgent, and I want to rest myself. Can I be
useful to you in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra drew some papers from his pocket-book and replied: &ldquo;My
father was wont to consult you in many things, and I remember that he
never had to do other than congratulate himself when he followed your
advice. I have on my hands a small undertaking and I want to be assured
of success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra then related to him briefly his plan for the erection of a
school house in honor of his betrothed. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>showed
the stupefied philosopher the plans which had been returned from
Manila.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I wish that you would advise me as
to what persons I ought first to have on my side in order to make the
undertaking most successful. You are well acquainted with the
inhabitants of the town. I have just arrived here and am almost a
stranger in my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man examined the plans which were laid out before him. His
eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That which you are going to carry
out was a dream of mine, the dream of a poor fool,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
greatly moved. &ldquo;And now, my first advice to you is that you never
come to consult me in regard to the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because sensible people,&rdquo; he
continued, in an ironical tone, &ldquo;will take you for a fool, like
myself. People always consider every one a fool who does not think just
as they do and, for this reason, they call me crazy. But I am obliged
to them for that, for woe be to me when the time arrives that they say
I have sense! That day, should it ever come, would deprive me of the
little liberty which I have purchased by sacrificing my reputation for
being sane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old man shook his head, as if to drive away a thought and
continued: &ldquo;My second advice to you is that you consult the
curate, the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>, and all the people of good
standing. They will all give you bad, foolish and useless advice, but
to consult does not mean to obey. Try to appear to be following their
advice as far as possible and make them think you are working according
to their wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra sat thinking for a moment and then replied: &ldquo;The advice
is good but difficult to follow. Could I not carry out my work without
a shadow reflecting upon it? Could I not carry out the good work in
spite of all? Does truth need to be clothed in the garments of
falsehood?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Nobody likes the
bare truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I hope to be able to realize all
my hopes without encountering great resistance,&rdquo; said Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, if the priests lend you their
hand; no, if they draw it away. All your efforts will be battered to
pieces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>against the walls of the curate&rsquo;s house. The
<i>alcalde</i> will deny to you to-morrow what he has granted you
to-day. Not a mother will let her son attend the school, and then all
your efforts will have just an opposite effect to that intended. You
will discourage all others who might wish to attempt beneficent
undertakings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; replied
Ibarra, &ldquo;I cannot believe in this power of which you speak. And
even supposing it to be true, admitting that it is as you say, would I
not still have on my side the sensible people and the
Government?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Government! The
Government!&rdquo; exclaimed the philosopher, raising his eyes and
looking at the ceiling. &ldquo;However much the Government may desire
to uplift the country for its own benefit and that of the mother
country; however generous may be the Catholic Kings in spirit, I must
remind you in confidence that there is another power which does not
allow the Government to see, hear, or judge except what the curates or
provincial priests wish. The Government is afraid of the advancement of
the people, and the people are afraid of the forces of the Government.
So long as the Government does not understand the people of the
country, the country will never get out from this guardianship. The
people will live like weak, young children who tremble at the sound of
the voice of their tutor, whose mercy they beg. The Government has no
dreams of a great future, a healthy development of the country. The
people do not complain, because they have no voice. They do not move,
because they are too carefully watched. You say that they do not
suffer, because you have not seen what would make your heart bleed. But
some day you will see it! alas! some day you will hear it. When the
light of day is thrown on their monstrous forms, you will see a
frightful reaction. That great force, held back for centuries, that
poison, distilled drop by drop, those sighs, so long
repressed&mdash;all will come to light and will some day burst
forth.... Who will then pay the accounts which the people will present
and which History preserves for us on its bloody pages?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God, the Government, and the
Church will never allow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=
"#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>that day to come!&rdquo; replied
Crisostomo, impressed in spite of himself. &ldquo;The Filipinos are
religious and they love Spain. The Filipinos will always know how much
this nation has done for them. There are abuses; yes! There are
defects; I do not deny it. But Spain is working to introduce reforms
which will correct them; she is devising plans; she is not selfish. Can
it be that my love for my native land is incompatible with love for
Spain? Is it necessary to lower one&rsquo;s self to be a good
Christian, to prostitute one&rsquo;s own conscience to bring about
good? I love my fatherland, the Philippines, because I owe to her my
life and my happiness&mdash;because every man should love his native
land. I love Spain, the fatherland of my ancestors, because, in spite
of all that may be said, the Philippines owe to Spain, and always will
owe to her, their happiness and their future. I am a Catholic. I hold
dear the belief of my fathers, and I do not see why I have to bow my
head when I am able to raise it; nor why I have to entrust it to my
enemies, when I can trample on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because the field in which you are
sowing your seed is in the hands of your enemies, and you are weak in
comparison to them.... It is necessary that you first kiss the
hand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young man did not allow him to go farther and exclaimed
violently: &ldquo;To kiss their hands! You forget that, between them,
they killed my father; they threw his body out of its sepulchre: but I,
I who am his son, I do not forget it, and, if I do not avenge myself,
it is because I consider the prestige of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old philosopher bowed his head. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;if you keep those
memories&mdash;memories which I cannot advise you to forget&mdash;if
you keep those memories, give up your plans and your undertaking and
try to work good for your countrymen in another way. The undertaking
needs another man than you for its execution, because to carry it out
will not only require money and care, but, in our country, self-denial,
tenacity and faith are also needed. The land is not ready for it; it
has been sown only with darnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra understood the weight of these words, but he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>was not
going to be discouraged. Thoughts of Maria Clara filled his mind; he
must fulfill his promise to her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Does not your experience suggest
something other than this hard method?&rdquo; he asked in a low
voice.</p>
<p>The old man took him by the arm and led him to the window. A cool
breeze was blowing from the north. Before his eyes lay the garden,
stretching out to the large forest which served as a park.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why do we not have to do the same
as that weak young bush loaded with roses and buds?&rdquo; said the
philosopher pointing to a beautiful rose bush. &ldquo;The wind blows,
shakes it and it bends itself down as if trying to hide its precious
load. If the bush kept itself erect, it would be broken off, the wind
would scatter its flowers and the buds would be blighted. The wind
passes over, and the bush straightens itself up again, proud of its
treasure. Thus it would be with you, a plant transplanted from Europe
to this stony ground, if you did not look about for some support and
belittle yourself. Alone and lofty, you are in bad
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And would this sacrifice bring the
fruits that I hope for?&rdquo; asked Ibarra. &ldquo;Would the priest
have faith in me and would he forget the offense? Would his kind not be
able to feign friendship, to make a false show of protecting me, and
then, from behind in the darkness, fight me, harass me and wound my
heels, thus making me waver more quickly than they could by attacking
me face to face? Given these premises, what do you think could be
expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man remained silent for some time, not being able to reply.
At last he said: &ldquo;If such a thing took place, if the undertaking
failed, I would console you with the thought that you had done all that
was in your power. And even so, something would be gained. Lay the
first stone, sow the first seed and after the tempest has passed over,
some little grain perhaps would germinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; exclaimed
Ibarra, stretching out his hand. &ldquo;Not in vain did I look for good
advice. This very day I shall go and make friends with the
curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking leave of the old man, he mounted on his horse and rode away.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; murmured the
pessimistic philosopher to himself, as he followed the young man with
his eyes. &ldquo;Let us observe carefully how Destiny will unfold the
tragedy which began in the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this time the philosopher was truly mistaken. The tragedy had
begun long before. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"

<h2 class="label">Chapter XIV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Eve of the Fiesta.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is the tenth of November, the eve of the
<i>fiesta</i> to be celebrated in the town of San Diego. Departing from
its habitual monotony, the town is displaying extraordinary activity in
the church, houses, streets, cock-pit, and the fields. Windows are
draped with flags and many-colored decorations. Music and the sound of
exploding fireworks fill the air. Everywhere there is rejoicing.</p>
<p>In the streets at fixed intervals, beautiful arches of bamboo are
raised, the wood carved and worked in a thousand different ways. The
arches are surrounded with ornaments, the very sight of which brings
joy to the heart of the small boy. In the church yard, a large and
costly awning has been erected. It is propped up by bamboo poles and so
arranged that the procession may pass under it. Under its shade the
children play, run, jump, fall and otherwise manage to tear and soil
their new shirts, which have been intended for the day of the
festival.</p>
<p>In the public square a platform has been built of bamboo, nipa and
boards, to serve as the stage. It is here that the comedy company from
Tondo will tell wonderful tales, and will compete with the gods in the
performance of miracles. Here Marianito, Chananay, Balbino, Ratia,
Carvajal, Yeyeng, Liceria and the others will sing and dance. The
Filipino loves the theatre, and always attends dramatic productions
with a great deal of pleasure. The <i>gobernadorcillo</i> was very fond
of the theatre, and, with the advice of the curate, he had selected for
the <i>fiesta</i> the fantastic comedy: &ldquo;Prince Villardo, or the
Nails Pulled Out of the Infamous Cave,&rdquo; a play full of magic and
fireworks.</p>
<p>From time to time the bells ring out their merry sounds.
Firecrackers and the booming of little cannon rend the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>air. The
Filipino pyrotechnist, who has learned his art without a teacher of any
renown, displays his skill, setting up pieces representing towers,
castles, and the like. Already the small boys are running at break-neck
speed toward the outskirts of the town to meet the bands of music. Five
organizations have been hired, besides three orchestras.</p>
<p>A band enters the town playing lively marches, and is followed by a
lot of ragged and half naked pickaninnies: this one, perhaps, has on
his brother&rsquo;s shirt; that one, his father&rsquo;s trousers. As
soon as the music stops, these little tots know by memory the piece
that has been played; they whistle and hum it with great delight,
showing at this early age their musical talent.</p>
<p>In the meantime wagons and carriages arrive, bringing relatives,
friends, and strangers. Gamblers are also on hand with their best
fighting cocks and bags of money, ready to risk their fortunes on the
green cloth or in the cock-pit.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The <i>alferez</i> gets fifty
dollars a night,&rdquo; murmured a little, chubby man when he heard of
the recent arrivals, for there were already many rumors that these
people bribed the officer so that they might not be interfered with by
the law. &ldquo;Captain Tiago,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is going to come
and will be banker in the monte game. Captain Joaquin brings eighteen
thousand. There is going to be a <i>liam-po</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2356src" href="#xd21e2356" name="xd21e2356src">1</a> and the
Chino Carlos is going to back it with ten thousand <i>pesos</i>
capital. Big bettors will come from Tanauan, Lipa, and Batangas, as
well as from Santa Cruz. It&rsquo;s going to be great! It&rsquo;s going
to be great! This year Captain Tiago will not skin us as he has in the
past, for he has not paid for more than three masses this year, and
besides, I have a <i>mutya</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2364src"
href="#xd21e2364" name="xd21e2364src">2</a> of cacao. And how are all
the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Very well, very well, thank
you!&rdquo; replied the visitors from the country.</p>
<p>But the place where the greatest animation reigns, where there is
almost a tumult, is over there on the level piece of ground, a short
distance from Ibarra&rsquo;s house. Pulleys creak, and the place
resounds with the sound of the hammer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>the chiseling of stones,
hewing of beams and the shouting of voices. A gang of workmen is making
an excavation which will be wide and deep; others are busy piling up
quarry stone, unloading carts, sifting sand, putting a capstan in place
and so on.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Put that here! That, there! Come,
be lively about it!&rdquo; shouts a little, old man with an animated
and intelligent physiognomy as he goes about, a yard stick and plumb
line in hand. He is the director of the work, &Ntilde;or Juan,
architect, mason, carpenter, whitewasher, locksmith, painter, stone
cutter, and, on occasion, sculptor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We must finish it immediately!
To-morrow nothing can be done, and day after to-morrow the ceremony of
laying the corner stone is to take place! Come, be lively!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Make the hole just large enough
for this cylinder!&rdquo; said he to one of the stone cutters who was
chiseling off a large quadrangular stone. &ldquo;Inside of this our
names will be kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he would repeat to every countryman who came along what he had
already said a thousand times: &ldquo;Do you know what we are going to
build? Well, it is a school house, a model of its kind, something like
those in Germany, but still better. The architect, Se&ntilde;or R.,
draughted the plans and I, I am in charge of the work. Yes, sir, you
see this is going to be a regular palace with two wings, one for the
boys and one for the girls. Here in the middle is to be a large garden
with three fountains. There, on the sides, groves, where the children
can sow and cultivate plants during the hours of recreation, thus
improving the time. Just see how deep the foundations are to be: three
meters and seventy-five centimeters. The building is going to have a
cellar where the indolent pupils will be confined. This will be very
close to the playing ground and the gymnasium, so that those who are
punished may hear the diligent pupils enjoying themselves. Do you see
this large space? Well, this will be a place for them to run and jump.
The girls will have a separate garden with benches, swings, a special
place for jumping the rope and rolling hoops, fountains and a
bird-house. This is going to be magnificent!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>He kept going from one end to the other, inspecting everything and
passing his opinion on all.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I find that you have got too much
lumber here for a crane,&rdquo; said he to a yellowish-looking fellow,
who was directing some other laborers. &ldquo;I would have enough, with
three large beams, to form the tripod and with three others to serve as
supporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;O, pshaw!&rdquo; replied the
other, smiling in a peculiar way. &ldquo;The more apparatus we give
ourselves, the greater effect we will produce. The massiveness of it
will make a bigger show and give it more importance. They will say:
&lsquo;What a lot of work has been done!&rsquo; You look at that crane
that I am constructing. In a little while, I am going to ornament it
with <i>banderolas</i>, garlands of flowers and leaves, and ... you
will say afterward that you were right in hiring me, and Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra cannot wish for more than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed. &Ntilde;or Juan also smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the plan for the school had been approved by
everybody and all were talking about it. The curate had asked to be
allowed to be one of the patrons of the enterprise and he himself was
to bless the laying of the corner stone, a ceremony which would take
place on the last day of the San Diego festival, as it was considered
one of the great solemnities.</p>
<p>The dismal presentiments of the old Tasio seemed to have been
dissipated forever. One day Ibarra told the old man so, but the old
pessimist only replied: &ldquo;Things may go well at first, but be on
your guard against masked enemies.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">As Night Comes On.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Great preparations had also been made in the house of
Captain Tiago. We are already acquainted with the man. His love for
pomp and his pride in being a resident of Manila made it necessary that
he should outdo the residents of the province in the splendor of his
celebration. There was another thing, too, which made it necessary that
he should try to eclipse all others&mdash;the fact that his daughter
Maria Clara and his future son-in-law were also there. His prospective
connection with Ibarra caused the Captain to be often spoken of among
the people.</p>
<p>Yes, as a matter of fact, one of the most serious newspapers in
Manila had printed an article on its first page, headed &ldquo;Imitate
Him!&rdquo; in which they offered Ibarra much advice and highly
eulogized him. The article spoke of him as &ldquo;the illustrious and
rich young capitalist.&rdquo; Two lines below, he was termed &ldquo;the
distinguished philanthropist,&rdquo; and, in the following paragraph,
referred to as the &ldquo;disciple of Minerva who went to his Mother
Country to salute the real birthplace of arts and sciences.&rdquo;
Captain Tiago was burning with generous emulation and was wondering
whether he ought not to erect a convent at his own expense.</p>
<p>Days before the week of festivities, numerous boxes of provisions
and drinks, colossal mirrors, pictures, paintings and his
daughter&rsquo;s piano had arrived at the house. Maria Clara and Aunt
Isabel were already living there. Captain Tiago came on the day before
the beginning of the festival. As he kissed his daughter&rsquo;s hand,
he made her a present of a beautiful religious relic. It was solid
gold, and set with diamonds and emeralds, and contained a little sliver
from Saint Peter&rsquo;s boat, in which Our Saviour sat while fishing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s interview with his future son-in-law could not
have been more cordial. Naturally, the school house was the subject of
conversation. Captain Tiago wanted him to call the school &ldquo;The
San Francisco School.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Believe me!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;San Francisco is a good patron saint. If you call it &lsquo;The
Primary School,&rsquo; you gain nothing. Who is Primary,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some friends of Maria Clara arrived and invited her to go for a
walk.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But return quickly,&rdquo; said
the Captain to his daughter, who asked for his permission. &ldquo;You
know that Father D&aacute;maso is going to dine with us to-night. He
has just arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning to Ibarra who was deep in thought, he added: &ldquo;You
will dine with us, too? You will be all alone at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure, I
assure you, if I did not have to be at home to-night to receive
visitors,&rdquo; replied the young man, mumbling his words and evading
Maria Clara&rsquo;s glance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bring your friends along with
you,&rdquo; replied Captain Tiago cheerfully. &ldquo;In my house there
is always enough to eat. And, besides I would like to have you and
Father D&aacute;maso understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be time enough for
that,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, putting on a forced smile and making ready
to accompany the young ladies.</p>
<p>They went downstairs. Maria Clara was walking between Victoria and
Iday, while Aunt Isabel followed behind.</p>
<p>As they passed down the street, people stood aside respectfully and
gave them the inside of the way. Maria Clara was surprisingly beautiful
now. Her paleness had disappeared, and although her eyes were
thoughtful, her mouth, on the contrary, seemed all smiles. With that
amiability known only to a happy maiden, she saluted friends she had
known from childhood who to-day were admirers of her youthful beauty.
In less than fifteen days she had regained that frank confidence, that
childish chatter, which seemed for awhile to have been left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>behind in the narrow walls of the convent. It
seemed as though the butterfly upon leaving its shell knew all the
flowers at once. It was enough that she be given a moment of flight and
an opportunity to warm herself in the golden rays of the sun, in order
to throw off the rigidity of the chrysalis. New life shone out in every
part of her young being. Everything she met with was good and
beautiful. Her love was manifested with virginal grace, and innocent in
thought, she saw nothing to cause her to put on false blushes. However,
she was wont to cover her face with her fan when they joked with her,
but her eyes would smile and a gentle tremor would pass over her whole
being.</p>
<p>In front of Captain Basilio&rsquo;s house were some young men who
saluted our acquaintances and invited them into the house. The merry
voice of Sinang was heard, as she descended the stairs on a run and at
once put an end to all excuses.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come up a moment so that I can go
out with you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It bores me to be among so many
strangers who talk about nothing but fighting-cocks and playing
cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went upstairs. The house was full of people. Some advanced to
greet Ibarra, whose name was known to all. They contemplated with
ecstacy Maria Clara&rsquo;s beauty, and some of the matrons murmured as
they chewed their betel-nut: &ldquo;She looks like the
Virgin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had partaken of chocolate they resumed their walk. In the
corner of the plaza a beggar was singing the romance of the fishes, to
the accompaniment of a guitar. He was a common sight, a man miserably
dressed and wearing a wide-brimmed hat made out of palm leaves. His
clothing consisted of a frock coat covered with patches, and a pair of
wide trousers such as the Chinese wear, but torn in many places. From
beneath the brim of his hat two fiery orbs flashed out a ray of light.
He was tall and from his manner seemed to be young. He put a basket
down on the ground and, afterwards walking away from it a little
distance, he uttered strange, unintelligible sounds. He remained
standing, completely isolated, as if he and the people in the street
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>were trying to avoid each other. Women approached
his basket, and dropped into it fish, fruit and rice. When there was no
one else to approach the basket, other sadder but less mournful sounds
could be heard; perhaps he was thanking them. He picked up his basket
and walked away to do the same in another place.</p>
<p>Maria Clara felt that this was a pitiful case. Full of interest, she
asked about the strange being.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is a leper,&rdquo; replied
Iday. &ldquo;He contracted the disease some four years ago; some say by
taking care of his mother, others by having been confined in a damp
prison. He lives there in the field near the Chinese cemetery. He does
not communicate with any one: everybody flees from him on account of
the fear of contagion. You should see his fantastic little house! The
wind, the rain and the sunshine go in and out of it as a needle goes
through cloth. They have prohibited him from touching anything
belonging to anybody. One day a little child fell into the canal. The
canal was deep, but this man happened to be passing near and helped to
get the little child out. The child&rsquo;s father learned of it, made
a complaint to the <i>gobernadorcillo</i> and the latter ordered that
he be given six stripes in the middle of the street, the whip to be
afterwards burned. That was atrocious! The leper ran away howling; they
pursued him and the <i>gobernadorcillo</i> cried out: &lsquo;Catch him!
One might better be drowned than have that disease!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; murmured
Maria Clara. And then, without noticing what she was doing, she went up
to the basket of the unfortunate wretch and dropped into it the relic
which her father had just presented to her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; her
friends asked her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have nothing else to give
him,&rdquo; she replied, concealing the tears in her eyes by a
smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what is he going to do with
the relic?&rdquo; said Victoria to her. &ldquo;One day they gave him
money but he pushed it away from him with his cane. Why would he care
for it, if no one would accept anything coming from him? If he could
only eat the relic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara looked longingly at the women who were selling
provisions and shrugged her shoulders. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the leper approached the basket, picked up the piece of jewelry
which shone in his hands, knelt down, kissed it, and, after taking off
his hat, buried his face in the dust on which the young girl had
walked.</p>
<p>Maria Clara hid her face behind her fan and raised her handkerchief
to her eyes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=

<h2 class="main">The Hoisting Crane.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While two of the actors were singing the <i lang=
"la">Incarnatus est</i> in the church at the celebration of mass on the
last day of the <i>fiesta</i>, and all were kneeling and the priests
were bowing their heads, a man whispered in Ibarra&rsquo;s ear:
&ldquo;During the ceremony of the blessing of the corner stone, do not
go near the priest, do not go in the ditch, do not approach the corner
stone. Your life will depend on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked and saw that it was Elias, the pilot, but, as soon as
he had spoken, he lost himself in the crowd.</p>
<p>The yellow-skinned man kept his word. It was not a simple lifting
crane which he had built over the ditch for the purpose of lowering the
enormous block of granite. It was not the mere tripod which &Ntilde;or
Juan had wanted for holding a tackle-block. It was something more. It
was at the same time a machine and an ornament, grand and imposing.</p>
<p>The confusing and complicated scaffolding had been raised to a
height of more than eight meters. Four heavy timbers buried in the
ground and supporting each other with colossal, diagonal braces, served
as the base. The braces were joined to each other by immense nails,
about half driven into the wood, perhaps because the apparatus was only
of a provisional nature, and it could then be more easily taken down.
Enormous cables were hanging from all sides, giving the entire
apparatus an aspect of solidity and grandeur. The top was gay with
flags and banners of various colors, floating pennants, and massive
garlands of flowers and leaves, all artistically interwoven.</p>
<p>On high, in the shade of the projecting timbers, banners and
wreaths, a large three-wheeled tackle-block was suspended by ropes and
iron hooks. Over the shining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>rims of these pulleys great cables
passed, holding suspended in the air a massive stone. The center of
this stone had been chiseled out so that when lowered upon the hollowed
stone, which had already been placed in the ditch, a small enclosure
would be formed between the two. This space was to contain an account
of the ceremonies, newspapers, manuscripts and coins, to be
transmitted, perhaps, to other generations, in the far distant future.
From this tackle-block at the top of the structure, the cable passed
down to another smaller pulley which was fastened at the base of the
apparatus. Through this pulley, the cable passed to the cylinder of a
windlass which was held to the ground by massive beams. This windlass
which can be operated by only two hands, multiplies man&rsquo;s
strength by means of a series of cog-wheels. Although there is a gain
in force, there is of course a loss in velocity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the
yellow-skinned man, as he gave the crank a turn. &ldquo;Look,
&Ntilde;or Juan, with my strength alone, I can raise and lower that
massive block of stone. This is so nicely arranged that I can control
the ascent or descent of the stone by inches. Thus one man below can
arrange the two stones in place, while I manipulate the apparatus from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&Ntilde;or Juan could but admire the man as he smiled in such a
peculiar manner. The curious people standing about made comments and
praised the yellow-skinned man for his work.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who taught you the
mechanism?&rdquo; asked &Ntilde;or Juan.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My father, my father who is now
dead,&rdquo; he replied, with that same peculiar smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And who taught your
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Saturnino, the grandfather of
Don Crisostomo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I did not know that Don
Saturnino&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, he knew a good many things.
Not only did he know how to whip well and how to expose his workmen to
the rays of the sun, but he knew also how to awaken the sleeping and
how to make those awake sleep. In time, you will see what my father has
taught me, you will see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the yellow fellow smiled in a strange manner.</p>
<p>At two eating stands, there was now being prepared a sumptuous and
abundant breakfast. However, on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"
href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>table designated for the little
ones of the school, there was no wine, but instead a larger amount of
fruit. In a covered passage which joined the two stands, there were
seats for the musicians and a table covered with sweetmeats, candies
and flasks of water, ornamented with leaves and flowers, for the
thirsty public.</p>
<p>The crowd, resplendent in gay-colored clothes, was already fleeing
from the hot rays of the sun and gathering under the shade of the trees
or of the covering. The small boys climbed the trees near the place, in
order to get a better view of the ceremony, and looked with envy upon
the school children, who, clean and well dressed, were occupying a
place designated for them. The fathers of the school children were
enthusiastic. They, poor countrymen that they were, would have the
pleasure of seeing their children eat on a white table cloth, just like
the curate and the <i>Alcalde</i>. Merely to think of it was enough to
drive away their hunger.</p>
<p>Soon strains of music were heard in the distance. A promiscuous
crowd of persons of all ages and dress was preceding the band. The
yellow-looking man was uneasy and was examining the whole apparatus. A
curious countryman was also following his glances and was observing
every movement he made. This countryman was Elias, who had also come to
attend the ceremony. His hat and his style of dress almost concealed
his identity. He had secured the best possible place for himself, right
up close to the crane, on the edge of the excavation.</p>
<p>With the band of music came the <i>Alcalde</i>, the officials of the
town, the friars, with the exception of Father D&aacute;maso, and the
Spanish employees of the Government. Ibarra was conversing with the
<i>Alcalde</i>, for they had become quite friendly from the time the
young man paid him some high compliments on his insignia, decorations
and cordon. Pride in belonging to an aristocratic family was a weakness
of His Excellency. Captain Tiago, the <i>alferez</i> and several
wealthy persons, with their shining silk hats, walked along, surrounded
by a group of youngsters. Father Salv&iacute; followed, the same as
ever, silent and pensive.</p>
<p>The young man could feel his heart beat as they approached
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>the designated place. Instinctively, he glanced at
the strange-looking scaffolding which had been raised there. He saw,
too, the yellow-looking man who saluted him with respect, and, for a
moment, Ibarra fixed his eyes on him. To his surprise, Ibarra also
discovered Elias on the edge of the excavation. He gave the young pilot
a significant look, letting him understand that he remembered what he
had said in the church.</p>
<p>The curate put on his sacerdotal vestments and began the ceremony.
The one-eyed sacristan mayor held the book and a choir boy was charged
with the water-sprinkler and the vessel of blessed water. The others
who stood around about, their heads uncovered, maintained a deep
silence. In spite of the fact that Father Salv&iacute; read in a low
tone, it could be noticed that his voice trembled.</p>
<p>In the meantime the articles, such as manuscripts, newspapers,
medals and coins, which were to be placed in the corner stone had been
enclosed in a little glass box, and hermetically sealed in a leaden
cylinder.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, do you wish
to put the box in its place? The curate awaits it,&rdquo; said the
<i>Alcalde</i> to Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I would do so with much
pleasure,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but I would be usurping the
honorable duty of the Se&ntilde;or Notary. The Notary ought to attest
the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Notary took it seriously, descended the carpeted stairs to the
bottom of the excavation and, with fitting solemnity, deposited the box
in the hollow which had been made in the stone. The curate then took up
the sprinkler and sprinkled the stones with holy water.</p>
<p>The time had now come for each one to put his trowelful of mortar on
the surface of the stone, which lay in the ditch, so that the other
stone might fit upon it and be made to adhere to it.</p>
<p>Ibarra presented the <i>Alcalde</i> with a trowel, upon whose wide
silver blade was engraved the date. But His Excellency first delivered
an address in Spanish.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Citizens of San Diego,&rdquo; he
said in a solemn tone. &ldquo;I have the honor to preside at a ceremony
the importance of which you already understand. A school is being
founded. The school is the base of society. The school is the book in
which is written the future of the people. Show me <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>the
schools of a people and I will tell you what those people are.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Citizens of San Diego! Thank God
that he has given you virtuous priests; and the Mother Country that she
untiringly diffuses her civilization over these fertile islands,
protected by her glorious flag. Thank God that she has had pity for
you, bringing you these humble priests that they may enlighten you and
teach you the divine word. Thank the Government for the great
sacrifices it has made, makes now and will make in the future for you
and your sons.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And now that the first stone of
this great edifice has been blessed, I, <i>Alcalde Mayor</i> of this
province, in the name of His Majesty, the King, whom God guard, King of
the Spains, in the name of the illustrious Spanish Government, and
under its spotless and ever victorious banner, I consecrate this act
and begin the building of this school.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Citizens of San Diego! Long live
the King! Long live Spain! Long live the Church! Long live the priests!
Long live the Catholic religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Viva! Viva!</i>&rdquo; replied
the others. &ldquo;Long live the <i>Alcalde</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Alcalde</i> majestically descended to the accompaniment of
the music which had begun to play. He placed some trowels of mortar on
the stone and with equal majesty ascended the stairs.</p>
<p>The Government employees applauded.</p>
<p>Ibarra offered another silver trowel to the curate, who, after
fixing his eyes on him for a moment, descended slowly to the bottom of
the excavation. When about half way down the stairs, he raised his eyes
to look at the stone which hung suspended in the air by the powerful
cables, but he only looked at it for a second and then descended. He
did the same as the <i>Alcalde</i> had done, but this time more
applause was heard, for the Government employees were assisted by the
other friars and Captain Tiago.</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; seemed to be searching for some one to whom to
hand the trowel. He looked with hesitation toward Maria Clara, but,
changing his mind, he offered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>it to the Notary. The latter, for the
sake of gallantry, approached Maria Clara, who declined it with a
smile. The friars, the Government employees and the <i>alferez</i>, one
after another went down and repeated the ceremony. Captain Tiago was
not forgotten.</p>
<p>Ibarra had been omitted. He was about to order the yellow man to
lower the other stone, when the curate remembered him. In a pleasant
tone and, with an affectation of familiarity, he said to him.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to put on your trowelful, Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I would be like the fellow who
made the stew and then ate it,&rdquo; replied the young man in the same
tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;O, go on!&rdquo; said the
<i>Alcalde</i>, giving him a gentle push. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I
will order them not to lower the stone and then we will have to wait
here till Judgment Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So terrible a threat forced Ibarra to obey. He exchanged the small
silver trowel for a larger iron one, which made some of the people
smile. He advanced quietly and descended the stairs. Elias looked at
him with an indescribable expression. If you had seen him, you would
have thought that all his life was concentrated in his eyes. The yellow
man looked down into the abyss opening at his feet.</p>
<p>Ibarra, after glancing at the stone which hung over his head, and
then at Elias and the yellow man, said to &Ntilde;or Juan in a
trembling voice: &ldquo;Give me the bucket of mortar and find another
trowel for me above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man stood alone. Elias was no longer looking at him; his
eyes instead were riveted on the yellow man&rsquo;s hand, while the
latter leaned over the ditch and followed with anxiety the movements of
Ibarra.</p>
<p>The noise of the trowel removing a mass of sand and lime was heard,
accompanied by the low murmur of the employees who were congratulating
the <i>Alcalde</i> on his address.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a frightful creaking. The pulley which was tied
to the base of the crane jumped and then the windlass struck the
apparatus like a battering-ram. The timbers swayed, ropes flew into the
air and, in a second, all came down with a terrible crash. A cloud of
dust was raised, and a thousand cries filled the air. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>Nearly
all fled; a few hurried to the ditch. Only Maria Clara and Father
Salv&iacute; remained in their places without moving, both pale and
silent.</p>
<p>When the cloud of dust had partially cleared away, Ibarra could be
seen standing among a mass of beams, bamboos, and cables, between the
windlass and the massive stone, which in its descent had shaken and
crushed everything. The young man was still holding the trowel in his
hand, his eyes staring with fright at the dead body of a man which was
lying at his feet, half buried under the timbers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you hurt?&mdash;Are you still
alive? For God&rsquo;s sake speak!&rdquo; said some of the employees,
full of terror.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Miracle! a miracle!&rdquo; cried
some.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come and remove the body of this
unfortunate man,&rdquo; said Ibarra, as if awakening from a dream.</p>
<p>On hearing his voice, Maria Clara felt her strength giving way and
she fell, half fainting, into the arms of her friends.</p>
<p>Great confusion reigned. Everybody was talking, gesticulating, and
running from one side to the other, up and down the stairs, all
stupefied and full of consternation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is the dead man? Is he still
alive?&rdquo; asked the <i>alferez</i>.</p>
<p>The body was identified as the yellow workman who had been standing
beside the windlass.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let proceedings be brought against
the superintendent of the work,&rdquo; was the first thing that the
<i>Alcalde</i> said.</p>
<p>They examined the body, felt of the heart, but it was no longer
beating. The blow had fallen on the head and blood was oozing from the
nose, ears and mouth. Some strange marks were seen on the man&rsquo;s
neck. There were four deep dents on one side and a single but deeper
one on the other. It looked as though an iron hand had grasped it like
a pair of pinchers.</p>
<p>The priests warmly congratulated the young man and shook his
hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When I think that only a few
moments ago I was standing there,&rdquo; said one of the employees.
&ldquo;Say! If I had been the last! <i>Jes&uacute;s!</i>&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It makes my hair stand on
end,&rdquo; said another, who was bald.</p>
<p>Ibarra had departed, to ascertain the condition of Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let this not prevent the festival
from continuing,&rdquo; said the <i>Alcalde</i>. &ldquo;God be praised!
The dead man is neither a priest nor a Spaniard! Your escape must be
celebrated! Just think&mdash;if the stone had fallen on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There is such a thing as a
presentiment!&rdquo; said the Notary. &ldquo;I said so. Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra was reluctant to descend. I saw it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let the festival go on! Give us
some music! Weeping will not bring the dead man to life. Captain, serve
warrants right here! Let the clerk of the tribunal come. Arrest the
superintendent of the work!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Put him in the stocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Put him in the stocks! Eh? Some
music, music! Put the <i>maestrillo</i> in the stocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rdquo;
replied Ibarra gravely, &ldquo;if weeping cannot bring the dead man
back to life, neither can anything be gained by putting a man in prison
when we do not know that he is culpable. I will give bail for him and
ask that he be given liberty for some days at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, well! But such a misfortune
must not be repeated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All kinds of comments were circulating among the people. The theory
that it was a miracle was already accepted. Father Salv&iacute;,
however, seemed to rejoice very little over the miracle, which the
people attributed to a saint of his order and of his parish.</p>
<p>There were some who claimed to have seen, as the crane was falling,
a figure dressed in black like the Franciscans, go down in the ditch.
It was without doubt San Diego himself. It was supposed, too, that
Ibarra had heard mass and that the yellow man had not. It was all as
clear as the light of the sun.</p>
<p>Ibarra went home to change his clothes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hm! Bad beginning,&rdquo; said Old
Tasio as he left the place.</p>
<p>Ibarra had just finished dressing when a servant announced that a
countryman was asking for him. Supposing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>that it was one of
his laborers, the young man ordered that they show him into his study,
which also served as a library and a chemical laboratory. But, to his
great surprise, he met the muscular figure of the mysterious Elias.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You recently saved my life,&rdquo;
said he in <span class="corr" id="xd21e2700" title=
"Source: Tagalo">Tagalog</span>, at once comprehending Ibarra&rsquo;s
movement. &ldquo;I have paid you only half of the debt, and you are not
indebted to me; rather the contrary. I have come to ask a favor of
you....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak out!&rdquo; replied the
young man, in the same language and somewhat surprised at the gravity
of the peasant.</p>
<p>For some seconds, Elias looked fixedly into Ibarra&rsquo;s eyes and
then replied: &ldquo;If human justice should ever wish to clear up this
mystery, I beg of you not to speak to any one about the warning that I
gave you in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be troubled about
that,&rdquo; replied the young man with a certain note of displeasure
in his voice. &ldquo;I know that they are hunting you, but I am no
informer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, it is not for my sake, it is
not for me!&rdquo; exclaimed Elias, not without some pride. &ldquo;It
is for your sake. I have nothing to fear from men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra&rsquo;s surprise increased. The tone in which the countryman
was speaking was new to him and did not seem to be in accord either
with his state or his fortune.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra, interrogating the mysterious man with his look.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not speak in enigmas; I try
to express myself clearly. For your greater security, it is necessary
that your enemies think you unsuspecting and off your guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra stepped back.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My enemies? Have I
enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All of us have, sir, all from the
lowest insect to man, from the poorest to the richest and most
powerful. Enmity is the law of life. You have enemies in the highest
and in the lowest ranks. You are planning a great undertaking; you have
a past; your father, your grandfather had enemies because they had
passion. In life it is not criminals who provoke the most hatred, but
rather honorable men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know my enemies?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>Elias did not reply at once, but meditated.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I knew one, the one who has
died,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Last night I discovered that something
was being plotted against you, through some words that were exchanged
between him and an unknown man who lost himself in the crowd.
&lsquo;The fish will not eat this one as they did his father; you will
see to-morrow,&rsquo; said he. These words attracted my attention, not
only on account of their meaning but because they were spoken by this
man, who only a few days ago had presented himself to the
superintendent of the work with the express desire that he be given
charge of the work of placing the corner stone. He did not ask for a
large wage, but made a great show of his knowledge. I had no sufficient
reasons to attribute evil designs to him, but something told me that my
suspicions were right. For this reason, in order to warn you, I chose a
moment and an occasion when you could not ask me any questions. You
already know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias was then silent for some moments; yet Ibarra did not reply nor
utter a word. He was meditating.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am sorry that the man is
dead,&rdquo; he replied at last. &ldquo;We might have been able to
learn something more about it from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If he had lived he would have
escaped from the trembling hand of blind, human justice. God has now
judged him! God has killed him! Let God be the only judge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crisostomo looked a moment at the man who was speaking to him in
this manner. He noticed that his muscular arms were covered with
bruises and black and blue spots.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you also believe in the miracle
version of the affair?&rdquo; he said, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;this
miracle of which the people speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I believed in miracles, I would
not believe in God. I would believe in a deified man. In fact, I would
believe that man had created God after his image and likeness,&rdquo;
he replied solemnly. &ldquo;But I believe in Him. More than once I have
felt His hand. When all was falling headlong, threatening destruction
for everything which was in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>place, I Held the criminal. I
put myself by his side. He was struck and I am safe and
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You? So that you...?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes! I held him when he wanted to
escape, once he had begun his fatal work. I saw his crime. I say:
&lsquo;Let God be the only judge among men. Let Him be the only one who
has the right to take away life. Let man never think of substituting
himself for him!<span class="corr" id="xd21e2750" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And, still you this
time....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; interrupted Elias,
foreseeing the objection that he was going to raise. &ldquo;It is not
the same thing. When a man as judge condemns another to death or
destroys his future forever, he does it with impunity and makes use of
the force of other men to carry out his sentence. Yet, after all, the
sentence may be wrong and unjust. But I, in exposing the criminal to
the same danger which he had prepared for others, ran the same risks. I
did not kill him. I allowed the hand of God to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you not believe in
chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To believe in chance is like
believing in miracles. Both theories suppose that God does not know the
future. What is a casualty? A happening which absolutely nobody knows
beforehand. What is a miracle? A contradiction, a contortion of the
laws of nature. Lack of foresight and contradiction in the All Knowing,
who directs the machinery of the world, are two great
imperfections.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Ibarra asked
again, with a certain dread. &ldquo;Have you studied?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have had to believe in God a
great deal because I have lost my faith in men,&rdquo; replied the
pilot, evading the question.</p>
<p>Ibarra thought that he understood this man; young and proscribed, he
disregarded human justice; denied the right of man to judge his equals,
he protested against power and superiority of certain classes of men
over others.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you must admit the necessity
of human justice, however imperfect it may be,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;God, although he has ministers on the earth, cannot, that is to
say, cannot clearly give his judgment upon the millions of contentions
which are stirred up by our passions. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>is necessary, it is
just, that a man should sometimes judge his fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For good, yes; for bad, no. To
correct and improve, yes; but not to destroy, for if he fails in his
judgment, there is no power that can remedy the evil that has been
done. But,&rdquo; he added, changing his tone, &ldquo;this discussion
is beyond and above me, and I am keeping you from those who are now
awaiting you. But do not forget what I have just said: You have
enemies. Take care of yourself for the good of your country!&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">Chapter XVII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Banquet.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There, under the shade of the decorated pavilion, the
great men of the province were banqueting. The <i>Alcalde</i> occupied
one end of the table; Ibarra, the other. On the young man&rsquo;s right
sat Maria Clara, and on his left, the Notary. Captain Tiago, the
<i>alferez</i>, the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>, the friars, the employees,
and the few se&ntilde;oritas who were present were seated, not
according to rank but according to their own fancy.</p>
<p>The banquet was very animated, but, before it was half over, a
messenger with a telegram came in search of Captain Tiago. The Captain
asked permission to read the message, and naturally all begged of him
to do so.</p>
<p>The worthy Captain at first knit his eyebrows; and then raised them.
His face became pale, and then brightened up. Doubling up the sheet of
paper hurriedly, he arose.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he,
confused, &ldquo;His Excellency, the Governor General, is coming this
afternoon to honor my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he started on a run, taking with him the telegram and the
napkin, but not his hat. All sorts of questions and exclamations were
shouted after him. The announcement of the coming of the
<i>tulisanes</i> could not have had a greater effect. &ldquo;But
listen! When does he come? Tell us about it! His Excellency!&rdquo; But
Captain Tiago was already far away.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;His Excellency is coming and will
be a guest at Captain Tiago&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; exclaimed some one,
without considering that the Captain&rsquo;s daughter and future
son-in-law were present.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The choice could not have been a
better one,&rdquo; replied another.</p>
<p>The friars looked at each other. Their expressions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>seemed to say: &ldquo;The Governor General is
committing another of his errors, offending us in this way. He ought to
be the guest of the convent.&rdquo; But despite the fact that they
thought this, they all kept silent and no one of them expressed his
opinion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Even yesterday he was speaking to
me about it,&rdquo; said the <i>Alcalde</i>, &ldquo;but, at that time,
His Excellency was not decided.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know, Your Excellency,
Se&ntilde;or Alcalde, how long the Governor General intends to remain
here?&rdquo; asked the <i>alferez</i>, a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, not positively. His Excellency
likes surprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Here come some other
telegrams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messages were for the <i>Alcalde</i>, the <i>alferez</i>, and
the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>, and announced the same thing to each of
them. The friars noticed that none came addressed to the curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;His Excellency will arrive at four
o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the <i>Alcalde</i>
solemnly. &ldquo;We can finish at our leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonidas, in the pass of Thermopyl&aelig;, could not have said with
better grace &ldquo;To-night we will dine with Pluto.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I notice the absence of our great
preacher,&rdquo; said one of the government employees timidly. The
speaker had an inoffensive look and before this had not opened his
mouth, except to eat, during the entire morning.</p>
<p>All who knew the life of Crisostomo&rsquo;s father twitched their
eyes significantly and seemed to say by their movements: &ldquo;Go on!
It&rsquo;s a bad beginning that you have made!&rdquo; But others, more
benevolently disposed, replied: &ldquo;He must be somewhat
fatigued.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What? Somewhat fatigued!&rdquo;
exclaimed the <i>alferez</i>. &ldquo;Why, he must be exhausted. What
did you think of the sermon this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Superb, gigantic!&rdquo; said the
Notary.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To be able to speak like Father
D&aacute;maso, a man needs lungs,&rdquo; observed Father Manuel
Martin.</p>
<p>The Augustine did not concede more than lung power.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And such easiness of
expression,&rdquo; added Father Salv&iacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know that Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra has the best cook in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>province,&rdquo; remarked the
<i>Alcalde</i>, cutting off the conversation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So they say,&rdquo; replied one of
the Government employees, &ldquo;but his fair neighbor does not wish to
do honor to his table, for she scarcely takes a mouthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara blushed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I thank you, Senor.... You occupy
yourself too much about me ... but ...&rdquo; she said timidly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But your presence honors him
sufficiently,&rdquo; concluded the gallant <i>Alcalde</i>. Then turning
to Father Salv&iacute;: &ldquo;Father Curate, I notice that you have
been silent and pensive all day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is my nature,&rdquo; muttered
the Franciscan. &ldquo;I would rather listen than talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Reverence seeks always to
gain and never to lose,&rdquo; replied the <i>alferez</i>, in a joking
manner.</p>
<p>But Father Salv&iacute; did not take it as a joke. His eyes flashed
a moment and he replied: &ldquo;You know very well, Se&ntilde;or
Alferez, that, during these days, I am not the one who gains
most!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> overlooked the fling with a false laugh and
pretended not to hear it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, gentlemen, I do not
understand how you can be talking about gains and losses,&rdquo;
intervened the <i>Alcalde</i>. &ldquo;What will these amiable and
discreet young women, who honor us with their presence, think of us? To
my mind, the young women are like &AElig;olian harps in the night. It
is only necessary to lend an attentive ear to hear them, for their
unspeakable harmonies elevate the soul to the celestial spheres of the
infinite and of the ideal....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency is a poet,&rdquo;
said the Notary gayly; and both drained their wine glasses.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; said the
<i>Alcalde</i>, wiping his lips. &ldquo;The occasion, if it does not
always make the thief, makes the poet. In my youth I composed verses,
and they certainly were not bad ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So Your Excellency has been
unfaithful to the Muses, deserting them for Themis.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Psh!&rdquo; What would you do? It
has always been my dream to run through the whole social scale.
Yesterday I was gathering flowers, and singing songs; to-day I hold

To-morrow....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To-morrow Your Excellency will
throw the wand into the fire to warm yourself with it in the winter of
life, and will then take a portfolio in the Ministry,&rdquo; added
Father Sibyla.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Psh! Yes ... no.... To be a
Minister is not precisely my ideal. The unexpected always happens,
though. A little villa in the north of Spain to pass the summer in, a
mansion in Madrid, and some possessions in Andalusia for the winter....
We will live remembering our dear Philippines.... Of me Voltaire will
not say: &lsquo;<i lang="fr">Nous n&rsquo;avons jamais
&eacute;t&eacute; chez ces peuples que pour nous y enrichir et pour les
calomnier.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government employees thought that His Excellency intended a joke
and they began to laugh to make a show of appreciating it. The friars
imitated them since they did not know that Voltaire was the
Volta-i-r&eacute; whom they had so often cursed and condemned to Hades.
Father Sibyla, however, recognized the name and assumed a serious air,
supposing that the <i>Alcalde</i> had uttered some heresy.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso was waddling down the road. He was half
smiling, but in such a malignant manner, that on seeing him, Ibarra,
who was in the act of speaking, lost the thread of his remarks. All
were surprised to see Father D&aacute;maso, but, excepting Ibarra, they
greeted him with marks of pleasure. They had already reached the last
course of the dinner, and the champagne was foaming in the glasses.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso showed a little nervousness in his smile when
he saw Maria Clara seated on the right of Crisostomo. But, taking a
chair by the side of the <i>Alcalde</i>, he asked in the midst of a
significant silence: &ldquo;Were you not talking about something,
se&ntilde;ores? Continue!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We were drinking a toast,&rdquo;
replied the <i>Alcalde</i>. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra was mentioning
those who had aided him in his philanthropic enterprise and was
speaking of the architect when Your Reverence....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t understand
architecture,&rdquo; interrupted Father D&aacute;maso, &ldquo;but
architects and the dunces who go to them make me laugh! You have an
example right here. I drew the plan for a church and it has been
constructed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>perfectly: so an English jeweler who was one day
a guest at the convent told me. To draught a plan, one need have but a
small degree of intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;However,&rdquo; replied the
<i>Alcalde</i>, seeing that Ibarra was silent, &ldquo;when we are
dealing with certain edifices, for example a school, we need a skilled
man (<i>perito</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He who needs a <i>perito</i> is a
<i>perrito</i> (little dog)!&rdquo; exclaimed Father D&aacute;maso,
with a scoff. &ldquo;One would have to be more of a brute than the
natives, who erect their own houses, if he did not know how to build
four walls and put a covering over them. That&rsquo;s all that a school
house is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All looked toward Ibarra. But the young man, even if he did look
pale, kept on conversing with Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But Your Reverence should
consider....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Just look you,&rdquo; continued
the Franciscan without allowing the <i>Alcalde</i> to speak. &ldquo;See
how one of our lay brothers, the most stupid one we have, has built a
good hospital, handsome and cheap. It is well built and he did not pay
more than eight <i>cuartos</i> a day to those whom he employed even
those who came from other towns. That fellow knows how to treat them.
He does not do like many fools and <i>mesticillos</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2971src" href="#xd21e2971" name="xd21e2971src">1</a> who spoil
them by paying them three or four <i>reales</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Does Your Reverence say that he
only paid eight <i>cuartos</i>? Impossible!&rdquo; said the
<i>Alcalde</i>, trying to change the course of the conversation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or; and those who
brag of being good Spaniards ought to imitate him. You can see very
well now, since the Suez Canal was opened, corruption has come here.
Before, when we had to double the Cape, there were not so many
worthless people coming out here, nor did Filipinos go abroad to be
corrupted and spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, Father
D&aacute;maso!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know very well what the native
is. As quickly as he learns anything, he goes and becomes a doctor. All
these ignoramuses who go to Europe....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But listen, Your Reverence
...&rdquo; interrupted the <i>Alcalde</i>, becoming uneasy at such
harsh words.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They are all going to end as they
merit,&rdquo; he continued. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>&ldquo;The hand of God is upon
them and one must be blind not to see it. Even in this life, the
fathers of such vipers receive their punishment.... They die in prison,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not finish his remarks. Ibarra, his face flushing, had
been following him with his eyes. On hearing the allusion to his
father, he rose and, with a single bound, brought down his strong hand
on the head of the priest. Stunned with the blow, the friar fell on his
back.</p>
<p>Full of astonishment and terror, no one dared to intervene.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Keep back!&rdquo; cried the young
man, with a menacing voice, and brandishing a sharp knife in his hand.
In the meantime, he held the friar down with his foot on his neck. The
latter was recovering consciousness. &ldquo;Let no one approach who
does not want to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was beside himself. His body trembled, and his threatening
eyes almost burst from their sockets. Friar D&aacute;maso struggled and
raised himself, but the young man, seizing him by the collar, shook him
till he fell on his knees and collapsed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra! Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra!&rdquo; cried some.</p>
<p>But nobody, not even the <i>alferez</i>, dared to approach the
glistening blade, considering the strength of the young man and the
state of his mind. All were paralyzed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All of you people here have said
nothing! Now the matter concerns me! I have avoided him. God now brings
him to me. Let God judge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was breathing hard. With iron hand he held the
Franciscan down, and the latter struggled in vain to break loose.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My heart beats tranquilly. My hand
is sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked about him and continued: &ldquo;Is there among you any one
who does not love his father; any one who hates his memory, any one who
was born in disgrace and humiliation? See! Do you observe this silence?
Priest of a peaceful God, with your mouth full of sanctity and
religion, and a miserable heart, you could not have known what a father
is. You should have thought of your own! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>Do you see? Among
this crowd which you scorn, there is none such as you! You are
judged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people around him made a stir, believing that he was going to
strike.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; he again cried in a
threatening voice. &ldquo;What? Do you fear that I would soil my hand
with his impure blood? Have I not told you that my heart beats
tranquilly? Back from us, all! Listen, priests, judges, you who think
yourselves different from other men, and who claim other rights for
yourselves! Listen! My father was an honorable man. Ask these people
who venerate his memory. My father was a good citizen. He sacrificed
himself for me and for the good of his country! His house was open. His
table was ready for the stranger or the exile who came to it in his
misery. He was a good Christian; he always did what was right. He never
oppressed the helpless, nor brought sorrow to the miserable and
wretched. To this man, he opened the door of his house. He had him sit
at his table and he called him his friend. What has he done in return?
He has calumniated him, persecuted him, has armed ignorance against
him, violating the sanctity of his office, has thrown him out of his
tomb, dishonored his memory, and persecuted him even in death&rsquo;s
repose. And not content with that, he now persecutes his son. I have
fled from him, I have avoided his presence. You heard him this morning
profane the pulpit; you saw him point me out to the popular fanaticism;
I said nothing. Now he comes here in search of a quarrel. To your
surprise, I suffered in silence; but he again insults the sacred memory
of my father, that memory which every son holds dear.... You who are
here, you priests, you judges, have you seen your father watching over
you night and day and working for you? Have you seen him deprive
himself of you for your good? Have you seen your father die in prison,
heart broken, sighing for some one to caress him, searching for some
being to console him, alone in sickness, while you were in a foreign
land? Have you heard his name dishonored afterward? Have you found his
tomb vacant when you wished to pray upon it? No? You are silent. Then
by that silence you condemn him!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>He raised his arm; but a young maiden, quick as a flash, put herself
between them and with her delicate hands stopped the arm of the
avenger. It was Maria Clara.</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at her with an expression that seemed to reflect
madness. Gradually, he loosened the vise-like fingers of his hand,
allowed the body of the Franciscan to fall, and dropped his knife upon
the ground. Covering his face, he fled through the crowd. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The house of Captain Tiago was no less disturbed than
the imagination of the people. Maria Clara, refusing to listen to the
consolation of her aunt and foster sister, did nothing but weep. Her
father had forbidden her to speak to Ibarra until the priests should
absolve him from the excommunication which they had pronounced upon
him.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago, though very busy preparing his house for the
reception of the Governor General, had been summoned to the
convent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, my girl,&rdquo;
said Aunt Isabel as she dusted off the mirrors. &ldquo;They will
certainly annul the excommunication; they will write the Pope.... We
will make a large donation.... Father D&aacute;maso had nothing more
than a fainting spell.... He is not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said
Andeng to her, in a low voice. &ldquo;I will certainly arrange it so
that you can speak to him. What are the confessionals made for, if we
are not expected to sin? Everything is pardoned when one has told it to
the curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Captain Tiago arrived. They scanned his face for an answer
to their many questions, but his expression announced too plainly his
dismay. The poor man was sweating, and passing his hand over his
forehead. He seemed unable to utter a word.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How is it, Santiago?&rdquo; asked
Aunt Isabel, anxiously.</p>
<p>He answered her with a sigh and dried away a tear.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, speak! What
has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What I had already feared!&rdquo;
he broke out finally half crying. &ldquo;All is lost! Father
D&aacute;maso orders that the engagement be broken. If it is not broken
off, I am condemned in this life and in the next. They all tell me the
same thing, even Father Sibyla! I ought to shut the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>doors of my house and ... I owe him more than
fifty thousand <i>pesos</i>. I told the Fathers so, but they would take
no notice of it. &lsquo;Which do you prefer to lose,&rsquo; they said
to me, &lsquo;fifty thousand <i>pesos</i>, or your life and your
soul?&rsquo; Alas! <i>Ay! San Antonio!</i> If I had known it, if I had
known it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara was sobbing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not cry, my daughter,&rdquo; he
added, turning to her. &ldquo;You are not like your mother. She never
cried ... she never cried except when she was whimsical just before
your birth.... Father D&aacute;maso tells me that a relative of his has
just arrived from Spain ... and that he wants him to be your
fianc&eacute;.&rdquo;...</p>
<p>Maria Clara stopped up her ears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, Santiago, are you out of your
head?&rdquo; cried Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;Speak to her now of another
fianc&eacute;! Do you think that your daughter can change lovers as
easily as she changes her dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was thinking the same thing,
Isabel. Don Crisostomo is rich.... The Spaniards only marry for love of
money.... But what would you have me do? They have threatened me with
excommunication. They say that I am in great peril: not only my soul,
but also my body ... my body, do you hear? My body!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you only give sorrow to your
daughter. Are you not a friend of the Archbishop? Why don&rsquo;t you
write him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Archbishop is also a friar.
The Archbishop does only what the friars say. But, Maria, do not cry.
The Governor General will come. He will want to see you and your eyes
are all inflamed.... Alas! I was thinking what a happy afternoon I was
going to pass.... Without this misfortune, I would be the happiest of
men and all would envy me.... Calm yourself, my girl. I am more
unfortunate than you and I do not cry. You can have another and better
fianc&eacute;, but I lose fifty thousand <i>pesos</i>. Ah! Virgin of
Antipolo! If I could only have some luck to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noises, detonations, the rumbling of carriages, the galloping of
horses, and a band playing the <i>Marcha Real</i> announced the arrival
of His Excellency, the Governor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>General of the Philippine
Islands. Maria Clara ran to hide in her bedroom.... Poor girl! Gross
hands were playing with her heart, ignorant of the delicacy of its
fibers.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the house filled with people. Loud steps, commands,
and the clanking of sabers and swords resounded on all sides. The
afflicted maiden was half kneeling before an engraving of the Virgin, a
picture representing her in that attitude of painful solitude, known
only to Delaroche, as if she had been surprised on returning from the
sepulchre of her Son. But Maria Clara was not thinking of the grief of
that Mother; she was thinking of her own. With her head resting on her
breast and her hands on the floor, she looked like a lily bent by the
storm. A future, cherished for years in her dreams; a future whose
illusions, born in her infancy and nursed through her youth, gave form
to the cells of her being&mdash;that future was now to be blotted from
the mind and heart by a single word!</p>
<p>Maria Clara was as good and as pious a Christian as her aunt. The
thought of an excommunication terrified her. The threat to destroy the
peace of her father demanded that she sacrifice her love. She felt the
entire strength of that affection which until now she had not known. It
was like a river which glides along smoothly; its banks carpeted with
fragrant flowers, its bed formed by fine sand, the wind scarcely
rippling its surface, so quiet and peaceful that you would say that its
waters were dead; until suddenly its channel is pent up, ragged rocks
obstruct its course, and the entangled trunks of trees form a dike.
Then the river roars; it rises up; its waves boil; it is lashed into
foam, beats against the rocks and rushes into the abyss.</p>
<p>She wanted to pray, but who can pray without hope? One prays when
there is hope. When there is none, we surrender ourselves to God and
wail. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried her heart, &ldquo;why shouldst thou
separate me thus from him I love? Why deny me the love of others? Thou
dost not deny me the sun, nor the air, nor dost thou hide the heavens
from my sight. Why dost thou deny me love, when it is possible to live
without sun, without air, and without the heavens, but without love,
never?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, mother,&rdquo; she was
moaning.</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel came to take her from her grief. Some of her girl
friends had arrived and the Governor General also desired to talk with
her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Aunt, tell them that I am
ill!&rdquo; begged the frightened maiden. &ldquo;They wish to make me
play the piano and sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your father has promised it. You
are not going to go back on your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara arose, looked at her aunt, clasped her beautiful arms
about her and murmured: &ldquo;Oh, if I had ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, without finishing the sentence, she dried her tears and began
to make her toilet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"

<h2 class="main">His Excellency.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I want to speak with that
young man,&rdquo; said His Excellency to an adjutant. &ldquo;He has
awakened my interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They have already gone to look for
him, General! But there is a young man here from Manila who insists on
being introduced. We have told him that Your Excellency has no time and
that you have not come to give audiences, but to see the town and the
procession. But he has replied that Your Excellency always has time to
dispense justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Excellency turned to the <i>Alcalde</i> as if in doubt.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I am not mistaken,&rdquo; said
the latter, making a slight bow, &ldquo;it is a young man who this
morning had a difficulty with Father D&aacute;maso about the
sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Still another? Has this friar
undertaken to disturb the province, or does he think that he is in
command here? Tell the young man to come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Excellency was walking nervously from one end of the <i>sala</i>
to the other.</p>
<p>In the lower part of the house, in the ante-room, were several
Spaniards, mingled with army officers and officials of the town of San
Diego and some of the neighboring villages. They were grouped in little
circles and were conversing about one thing and another. All of the
friars were there except Father D&aacute;maso, and they wanted to go in
and pay their respects to His Excellency.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;His Excellency, the Governor
General, begs Your Reverences to wait a moment,&rdquo; said the
adjutant. &ldquo;Walk in, young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man from Manila entered the <i>sala</i>, pale and
trembling.</p>
<p>Everybody was surprised. His Excellency must be irritated to dare to
make the friars wait. Father Sibyla <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>said: &ldquo;I have
nothing to say to him.... I am losing time here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with
me,&rdquo; said an Augustine. &ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Would it not be better for us to
find out what he thinks?&rdquo; asked Father Salv&iacute;. &ldquo;We
would avoid a scandal ... and ... we would be able to call to his mind
his duty to ... the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Reverences can walk in, if
you wish,&rdquo; announced the adjutant, as he escorted out the young
man, whose face was now, however, glowing with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Friar Sibyla entered first. Behind him came Father Salv&iacute;,
Father Manuel Martin and the other priests. They all humbly saluted the
Governor General, with the exception of Father Sibyla, who preserved
even in his bow, an air of superiority. Father Salv&iacute;, on the
contrary, almost touched the floor with his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Which of Your Reverences is Father
D&aacute;maso?&rdquo; asked His Excellency unexpectedly, without having
them sit down, or even asking about their health, and without
addressing them with any of those courteous phrases which are customary
with such high personages.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso is not among
us, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Father Sibyla, rather dryly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency&rsquo;s servant
lies ill in bed,&rdquo; added Father Salv&iacute; meekly. &ldquo;After
having the pleasure of saluting you and of inquiring about the health
of Your Excellency, as befits all the good servants of the King and all
persons of good education, we also come in the name of the respectful
servant of Your Excellency who has the misfortune....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interrupted the
Governor General, as he turned a chair around on one leg and smiled
nervously. &ldquo;If all the servants of My Excellency were like His
Reverence Father D&aacute;maso, I would prefer to serve My Excellency
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Reverences did not know how to respond to this interruption.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take a seat, Your
Reverences!&rdquo; he added after a short pause, softening his tone a
little.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago came in dressed in a frock coat and walking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>on tip-toes. He was leading Maria Clara by the
hand. The young maiden was trembling when she entered, but
notwithstanding she made a graceful and ceremonious bow.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is this your daughter?&rdquo;
asked the Governor General, somewhat surprised.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And Your Excellency&rsquo;s, my
General,&rdquo; replied Captain Tiago seriously.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3186src" href="#xd21e3186" name="xd21e3186src">1</a></p>
<p>The <i>Alcalde</i> and the adjutants opened wide their eyes, but His
Excellency did not lose his gravity. He extended his hand to the young
maiden and said to her affably: &ldquo;Happy are the fathers who have
daughters like you, se&ntilde;orita. They have spoken to me about you
with respect and consideration.... I have desired to see you and to
thank you for your pretty deed of to-day. I am informed of all, and
when I write to His Majesty&rsquo;s Government I will not forget your
generous conduct. In the meantime, se&ntilde;orita, allow me in the
name of His Majesty the King whom I represent here and who loves to see
peace and tranquillity among his subjects, and in my own name, that of
a father who also has daughters of your age, allow me to extend to you
most sincere thanks and propose your name for some mark of
recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or ...&rdquo; replied
Maria Clara, trembling.</p>
<p>His Excellency guessed what she wanted to say, and replied:
&ldquo;It is well enough, se&ntilde;orita, that you are satisfied in
your own conscience with the mere esteem of your own people. The
testimony of one&rsquo;s people is the highest reward and we ought not
to ask more. But, however, I will not let pass this excellent
opportunity to show you that, if justice knows how to punish, she also
knows how to reward and is not always blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Don Juan Crisostomo
awaits Your Excellency&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; announced the adjutant in
a loud voice.</p>
<p>Maria Clara trembled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the Governor
General. &ldquo;Permit me, se&ntilde;orita, to express the desire to
see you again before I leave town. I still have some very important
things to say to you. Se&ntilde;or <i>Alcalde</i>, Your Lordship will
accompany <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>me for a walk after the conference which I will
hold alone with Se&ntilde;or Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency will permit
us,&rdquo; said Father Salv&iacute; meekly, &ldquo;to inform you that
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra is excommunicated ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Excellency interrupted him saying: &ldquo;I am glad that I have
nothing more to deplore than the condition of Father D&aacute;maso, for
whom I sincerely wish a complete recovery, because at his age a voyage
to Spain for his health would not be pleasant. But this depends on him
... and in the meantime, may God preserve the health of Your
Reverences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They retired one after the other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We will see who will make the
journey first,&rdquo; said a Franciscan.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am going off now right
away!&rdquo; said Father Sibyla, with indignation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And we are going back to our
provinces, too,&rdquo; said the Augustins.</p>
<p>They could not endure that through the fault of a Franciscan His
Excellency had received them coldly.</p>
<p>In the entrance hall they met Ibarra, their host only a few hours
ago. They exchanged no salutations, but their looks were eloquent.</p>
<p>The <i>Alcalde</i>, on the contrary, when the friars had
disappeared, greeted the young man and extended his hand to him in a
familiar way. But the arrival of the adjutant, who was looking for
Ibarra, did not give them an opportunity to converse.</p>
<p>Ibarra was dressed in deep mourning. He presented himself in a calm
manner, and bowed profoundly, despite the fact that the sight of the
friars had not seemed a good omen for him.</p>
<p>The Governor General advanced a few steps. &ldquo;It gives me great
satisfaction to shake your hand. Grant me your entire
confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or ... such
kindness...!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your surprise offends me. It
indicates that you did not expect a good reception from me. That is
doubting my justice!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A friendly reception,
se&ntilde;or, for an insignificant subject like myself, is not justice,
it is a favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said His
Excellency, sitting down and pointing out a seat for Ibarra. &ldquo;Let
us speak frankly. I am very much pleased with your action and I have
already proposed to His Majesty&rsquo;s Government that they grant you
an insignia for your philanthropic intention of erecting a school....
If you had asked me, I would have attended the ceremony with a great
deal of pleasure and perhaps the unpleasantness would have been
avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My idea of erecting a school seems
to me so insignificant,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;that I did
not think it an occasion worthy of taking the attention of Your
Excellency from your many duties and cares. Then, too, it was my duty
to first address the highest authority of the province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Excellency made a bow of satisfaction and adopting a still more
intimate manner, continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In regard to the unpleasantness
which you have had with Father D&aacute;maso, have no fear nor regret.
I will not touch a hair of your head while I govern these Islands. And
in regard to the excommunication, I will speak to the Archbishop, for
it is necessary for us to adapt ourselves to circumstances. Here, we
cannot laugh about these things in public as we do in Spain or in
cultured Europe. Nevertheless, be more prudent in the future. You have
put yourself in opposition to the religious corporations, which, on
account of your position and wealth, need to be respected. But I will
protect you, because I like good sons, I like to see a person respect
the honor of his father. I, too, love my father, and as sure as there
is a God, I know what I would have done had I been in your
place....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And quickly turning the conversation, he asked: &ldquo;You have told
me that you come from Europe; were you in Madrid?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or; for some
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have perhaps heard of my
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency had just left when
I had the honor to be presented to it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And why, then, did you come here
without bringing some letter of introduction?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Ibarra bowing, &ldquo;because I do not come directly from Spain, and
because, having heard of Your Excellency&rsquo;s character, I thought
that a letter of introduction would not only be useless, but even
offensive. All Filipinos are recommended to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile appeared on the lips of the old officer and he replied
slowly, as if weighing and measuring his words:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It flatters me to learn that you
think so ... and ... so it ought to be. However, young man, you ought
to know what loads we bear upon our shoulders here in the Philippines.
Here, we, old army officers, have to do and be everything: King,
Secretary of State, of War, of Agriculture, of Internal Affairs and of
Justice. The worst part of it is the fact that in regard to everything
we have to consult our distant Mother Country, which approves or
rejects our propositions, according to circumstances, sometimes
blindly. And you know how we Spaniards say: &lsquo;Grasp much, get
little.&rsquo; Then, too, we come here ignorant of the country and we
leave it as soon as we begin to know it. With you I can be frank, for
it would be useless to appear otherwise. In Spain, where each branch of
the Government has its own Minister, born and brought up in the
country, where they have the press and public opinion, the opposition
is open and before the eyes of the Government, and shows up its faults;
yet, even there, all is imperfect and defective. And when you consider
the conditions here, it is a wonder that all is not upset, with all
those advantages lacking, and with the opposition working in the dark.
Good intentions and wishes are not wanting in us governing officials,
but we find ourselves obliged to make use of eyes and arms which
frequently we do not know, and which, perhaps, instead of serving the
country, serve only their own interests. That is not our fault; it is
the fault of circumstances. You arouse my interest and I do not want
our present system of government to prejudice you in any way. I cannot
watch everything, nor can I attend to all. Can I be useful to you in
any way? Have you anything to request?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra meditated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;my greatest desire is the happiness of my country, a happiness
due to the efforts of our Mother Country and to the efforts of my
fellow countrymen, united with the eternal bonds of a common interest
and common object. What I ask the Government can only give after many
years of continuous work and proper reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Excellency looked at him for several seconds with a look which
Ibarra met naturally, without timidity and without boldness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are the first <i>man</i> with
whom I have spoken in this country,&rdquo; he exclaimed grasping his
hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency has only seen
those who lead a grovelling existence in the city. You have not seen
the calumniated hovels of our towns. If you had, you would have seen
true men, if generous hearts and simple manners make true
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor General arose and paced the <i>sala</i> from one side
to the other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, stopping a moment. The young man arose. &ldquo;I will
probably leave here within a month. Your education and your mode of
thinking are not for this country. Sell what you possess, get your
trunk ready and come with me to Europe. That climate will be better for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall cherish all my life the
memory of Your Excellency&rsquo;s kindness,&rdquo; replied Ibarra,
moved by what the Governor General had said. &ldquo;But I ought to live
in the country where my fathers have lived....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where they have died, you should
say, to speak more exactly. Believe me! I possibly know your country
better than you do yourself.... Ah! Now I remember,&rdquo; he exclaimed
changing the tone of his voice. &ldquo;You are going to marry a lovely
girl and I am keeping you here! Go, go to her side, and that you may
have greater liberty send her father to me,&rdquo; he added, smiling.
&ldquo;Do not forget, however, that I want you to accompany me for a
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra bowed and departed.</p>
<p>His Excellency called his adjutant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; said he, giving
him a light slap on the shoulder. &ldquo;To-day I have seen for the
first time how one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>can be a good Spaniard without ceasing to
be a good Filipino and to love his country. To-day, at last, I have
shown the <i>Reverences</i> that we are not all their playthings. This
young man has afforded me the opportunity, and, in a short time, I will
have settled all of my accounts with the friar. It&rsquo;s a pity that
this young man, some day or other ... but call the <i>Alcalde</i> to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter presented himself at once.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rdquo; he
said to him, as he entered the room, &ldquo;in order to avoid a
repetition of scenes such as Your Honor witnessed this afternoon,
scenes which I deplore because they take away the prestige of the
Government and all Spaniards, I want to commend to you warmly
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, that you may not only aid him in carrying out his
patriotic ends, but also prevent in the future any person of whatever
class or under whatever pretext, from molesting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Alcalde</i> understood the reprimand and bowed to conceal his
confusion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have the <i>alferez</i>, who is in
command here, informed to the same effect. And you will find out if it
is true that this officer has methods of procedure that are not in
accordance with the regulations. I have heard more than one complaint
on this score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tiago, all starched and ironed, presented himself.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Santiago,&rdquo; said His
Excellency, in a cordial tone of voice, &ldquo;a little while ago I was
congratulating you on having a daughter like the Se&ntilde;orita de los
Santos. Now I want to congratulate you on your future son-in-law. The
most virtuous of daughters is certainly worthy of the best citizen of
the Philippines. Is the date of the wedding known?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; stammered the
Captain, wiping away the perspiration which was running down his
face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;O, come! I see that there is
nothing definite. If you need godfathers, I will be one of them with
the greatest pleasure. I would do it to take away the bad taste which
so many of the weddings which I have attended here have left in my
mouth,&rdquo; he added, turning to the <i>Alcalde</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; replied
Captain Tiago, with a smile which inspired compassion.</p>
<p>Ibarra had gone in search of Maria Clara, almost on a run. He had so
many things to tell her. He heard some gentle voices in one of the
rooms and knocked at the door.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who knocks?&rdquo; asked Maria
Clara.</p>
<p>The voices were silenced and the door ... was not opened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is I. May I come in?&rdquo;
asked the young man, his heart beating violently.</p>
<p>The silence was not broken. A few seconds afterward gentle steps
approached the door and Sinang&rsquo;s cheerful voice murmured through
the key-hole: &ldquo;Crisostomo, we are going to the theatre to-night.
Write what you have to say to Maria Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the footsteps were heard retreating, as quickly as they had
come.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does that mean!&rdquo;
murmured Ibarra to himself, as he went slowly away from the door.

<h2 class="label">Chapter XX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Procession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the evening, by the light of lanterns hung from
windows, to the ringing of bells and bursting of bombs, the procession
started for the fourth time.</p>
<p>The Governor General left the house on foot, in company with his two
adjutants, Captain Tiago, the <i>Alcalde</i>, the <i>alferez</i>, and
Ibarra. The Civil Guards and the officials of the town preceded them
and cleared the way. His Excellency had been invited to witness the
procession from the house of the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>, in front of
which a platform had been erected for the recitation of a <i>loa</i>,
or religious poem, in honor of the Patron Saint. Ibarra had previously
declined with pleasure an invitation to hear this poetical composition,
as he had preferred to witness the procession from the house of Captain
Tiago with Maria Clara and her friends. But, as His Excellency wished
to hear the <i>loa</i>, there was no other remedy for Ibarra but to
console himself with the hope of seeing her at the theatre.</p>
<p>The procession was headed by three sacristans carrying silver
candlesticks. The children of the school, accompanied by their teacher,
followed. Then came the small boys, with colored paper lanterns
fastened to the ends of pieces of bamboo, each more or less adorned
according to the caprices of the boy, for this part of the illumination
was paid for entirely by themselves. However, they fulfilled this duty
with a great deal of pleasure.</p>
<p>In the midst of it all, men serving as police, passed to and fro to
see that the files of the procession were not broken or the people
jammed together in a crowd. For this purpose they used their wands and
inflicted some hard blows, thus managing to add to the brilliancy of
the procession, to the edification of souls and to the glory of
religious pomp. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the same time that the officers inflicted these sanctified
floggings with their wands free of charge, others, to console those who
had been punished, distributed wax and tallow candles, also free of
charge.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, in a low voice, &ldquo;do they inflict those blows to punish
the sinners or merely for pleasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right, Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra,&rdquo; replied the Governor General, who had overheard his
question. &ldquo;This spectacle ... barbarous ... astonishing to those
who come from other countries, ought to be prohibited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it cannot be explained, the first saint who appeared was
San Juan el Baptisto. On seeing him, you would say that the cousin of
Our Saviour did not enjoy any great renown among these people. He had
slender feet and legs and the face of a hermit, and was carried along
on an old wooden litter. In marked contrast to the representation of
San Juan, was that of San Francisco, the founder of the great order.
The latter was drawn in a car, and, as Tasio said: &ldquo;What a car!
How many lights and glass lanterns! Why, I have never seen you
surrounded by so many illuminations, Giovanni Bernardone! And what
music!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the music came a standard representing the same saint, but
with seven wings. It was carried by the brothers of the Third Order,
dressed in <i>guingon</i> and praying in a loud and mournful voice. The
next in the procession was Santa Maria Magdalena, a most beautiful
image with an abundant growth of hair, a handkerchief of embroidered
<i>pi&ntilde;a</i> cloth between her ring-covered fingers, and wearing
a dress of silk adorned with gold-leaf. Lights and incense surrounded
her. The glass tears from her eyes reflected the colors of the colored
fire which was burned here and there, giving a fantastic aspect to the
procession. Consequently, the sinful saint appeared to be weeping now
green, now red and now blue tears. The people did not begin to burn
these colored lights till San Francisco was passing; San Juan el
Baptisto did not enjoy this honor, passing by quickly, ashamed perhaps
to go dressed in skins among so many saints covered with gold and
precious jewels. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"
name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There goes our saint!&rdquo; cried
the daughter of the <i>gobernadorcillo</i> to her visitors. &ldquo;I
loaned her my rings, but I did it to get to Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those carrying the illuminations stopped near the platform to hear
the <i>loa</i>. The saints did the same. They and their carriers wanted
to hear the verses. Those who carried San Juan, tired of waiting,
squatted down in the characteristic Filipino manner, and found it
convenient to leave their burden on the ground.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get into
trouble,&rdquo; objected one.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> In the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3417" title=
"Source: sacristry">sacristy</span>, they leave him in a corner among
spider-webs....&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Magdalena came the women. They differed from the men in
arrangement. Instead of the children, the old women came first and
finally the unmarried women. Behind these came the car of the Virgin,
and behind that, the curate under his canopy. Father D&aacute;maso gave
the following reason for putting the young women next to the
Virgin&rsquo;s car: &ldquo;The Virgin likes young women, but not old
ones.&rdquo; Of course, this explanation caused many of the older women
to make wry faces, but that did not change the taste of the Virgin.</p>
<p>San Diego followed Magdalena, but he did not seem to rejoice over
the fact, for he was as precise in his behavior as on the morning when
he followed along behind San Francisco. Six brothers of the Third Order
drew the car. San Diego stopped before the platform and awaited for the
people to salute him.</p>
<p>But it was necessary to await the car which contained the image of
the Virgin. Preceding this car were some people dressed in a fantastic
manner which made children cry and babies scream. In the midst of that
dark mass of habits, hoods and girdles, to the sound of that monotonous
and nasal prayer, one could see, like white jessamine, like fresh
pansies among old rags, twelve young lassies dressed in white, crowned
with flowers, with hair curled and eyes bright as the necklaces they
wore. Seizing hold of two wide blue bands which were tied to the car of
the Virgin, they drew it along, reminding one of doves drawing the car
of Spring.</p>
<p>And now when the images were all attentive, when this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>child and that had been slapped sufficiently to
make him listen to the verses, when everybody had his eyes fixed on the
half open curtain, at last, an <i>aaaah!</i> of admiration escaped from
the lips of all.</p>
<p>And the sight merited it. A young child appeared with wings, riding
boots, a cordon over its shoulder, a belt and a plumed hat.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Alcalde!&rdquo;
cried some one, but the young prodigy recited a poem in such a manner
that the <i>Alcalde</i> was not offended at the comparison.</p>
<p>The procession then continued. San Juan followed out his bitter
career.</p>
<p>As the Virgin passed before the house of Captain Tiago, a heavenly
song greeted her like the words of an archangel. It was a sweet,
melodious, supplicating voice, weeping the <i>Ave Maria</i> of Gounod.
The music of the procession was silenced, the praying ceased, and
Father Salv&iacute; himself stopped. The voice trembled and brought
tears to the cheeks of those who heard it. That voice expressed more
than a salutation, a prayer, or a plaint.</p>
<p>From the window, where he was viewing the procession, Ibarra heard
the voice, and melancholy took possession of his heart. He understood
what that soul was suffering and what was expressed in that song. He
was afraid to think of the cause of that grief.</p>
<p>The Governor General found him pensive and sad. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Do&ntilde;a Consolacion.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Why were the windows in the <i>alferez&rsquo;s</i>
house closed? Where was the masculine face and the flannel shirt of the
Medusa or Muse of the Civil Guard while the procession was passing?
Could she have understood how unpleasant was the sight of the swelling
veins of her forehead, filled, it seemed, not with blood but with
vinegar and bile; of her large cigar, that worthy ornament of her red
lips; and of her envious look; could she have understood all of that,
and, giving way to a generous impulse, have refrained from disturbing
the gayety of the crowd by her sinister apparition?</p>
<p>Alas! Her generous impulses lived only in the golden age.</p>
<p>Her house was sad because other people were merry, as Sinang put it.
There neither lanterns nor flags could be seen. In fact, if the sentry
were not walking up and down in front of the gate, you would have said
that the house was unoccupied.</p>
<p>A feeble light illumined the disarranged <i>sala</i>, and made
transparent the oyster-shell windows filled with spider-webs and
covered with dust. The Se&ntilde;ora, according to her custom, her
hands folded, sat in a wide arm-chair. She was dressed the same as
every day, that is to say, outrageously out of taste. In detail, she
had a handkerchief tied around her head, while short, slender locks of
tangled hair hung down on either side; a blue flannel shirt over
another shirt which should have been white; and a faded-out skirt which
moulded itself to her slender thighs as she sat with her legs crossed
and nervously wiggled her foot. From her mouth, came big puffs of
smoke, which she fastidiously blew up in the space toward which she
looked when her eyes were open. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130"
href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>That morning the Se&ntilde;ora had not heard mass, not because she
had not cared to hear it, for on the contrary she wanted to show
herself to the multitude and to hear the sermon, but because her
husband had not permitted her to do so. As was usually the case, his
prohibition was accompanied by two or three insults, oaths and threats
of kicking. The <i>alferez</i> understood that his &ldquo;female&rdquo;
dressed herself in a ridiculous manner, and that it was not fitting to
expose her to the eyes of the people from the capital nor even the
country districts.</p>
<p>But she did not understand it that way. She knew that she was
beautiful, attractive, that she had the manners of a queen and that she
dressed much better and more gorgeously than Maria Clara herself,
though to be sure the latter wore a <i>tapis</i> over her skirt while
she wore only the skirt. The <i>alferez</i> had to say to her:
&ldquo;Oh, shut your mouth or I&rsquo;ll kick you till you
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion did not care to be kicked, but she planned
revenge.</p>
<p>The dark face of the Se&ntilde;ora never had inspired confidence in
anybody, not even when she painted it. That morning she was
exceptionally uneasy, and as she walked from one end of the <i>sala</i>
to the other, in silence and as if meditating something terrible, her
eyes shone like those of a serpent about to be crushed. Her look was
cold, luminous, and penetrating and had something vicious, loathsome
and cruel in it.</p>
<p>The slightest defect in anything, the most insignificant or unusual
noise brought forth an obscene and infamous expression; but no one
responded. To offer an excuse was a crime.</p>
<p>So the day passed. Encountering no obstacle in her way&mdash;her
husband had been invited out&mdash;she became saturated with bile.</p>
<p>Everything around bent itself before her. She met no resistance,
there was nothing upon which she could discharge the vials of her
wrath. Soldiers and servants crawled before her.</p>
<p>That she might not hear the rejoicing going on outside, she ordered
the windows to be closed, and charged the sentry not to permit any one
to enter. She tied a handkerchief <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>around her head to prevent it
from bursting; and, in spite of the fact that the sun was still shining
brightly, she ordered the lamps lighted.</p>
<p>A madwoman who had been detained for disturbing the public peace was
taken to the barracks. The <i>alferez</i> was not there at the time and
the unhappy woman had to pass the night seated on a bench. The
following day the <i>alferez</i> returned. Fearing lest the unhappy
woman should become the butt of the crowd during the <i>fiesta</i>, he
ordered the soldiers who were guarding her to treat her with pity and
give her something to eat. Thus the demented woman passed two days.</p>
<p>Whether the proximity to Captain Tiago&rsquo;s house made it
possible for the sad song of Maria Clara to reach her ears, whether
other strains of music awoke in her memories of old songs, or whether
there was some other cause for it, at any rate, the madwoman began that
night to sing with a sweet and melancholy voice the songs of her youth.
The soldiers heard her and kept silent. Those songs brought back
memories of the old times.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion also heard it in her sorrow, and became
interested in the person who was singing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell her to come upstairs at
once!&rdquo; she ordered, after some seconds of meditation. Something
like a smile passed over her dry lips.</p>
<p>They brought the woman and she presented herself without any
discomposure, and without manifesting either fear or surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Orderly, tell this woman in
Tagalog to sing!&rdquo; said the <i>alfereza</i>. &ldquo;She
don&rsquo;t understand me; she does not know Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demented woman understood the orderly and sang the song
&ldquo;Night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion listened to the beginning with a mocking
smile which disappeared gradually from her lips. She became attentive,
then more serious and pensive. The woman&rsquo;s voice, the sentiment
of the verses and the song itself impressed her. That dry and burning
heart was perhaps softened. She understood the song well:
&ldquo;Sadness, cold, and dampness, wrapped in the mantle of Night
descend from the sky,&rdquo; as the folk song <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>puts
it. It seemed that they were also descending upon her heart. &ldquo;The
withered flower which during the day has paraded its dress, desirous of
applause and full of vanity, at nightfall repenting, makes an effort to
raise its faded petals to the sky, and begs for a little shade in which
to hide itself, so as to die without the mockery of the light which saw
it in its pomp, to die without the vanity of its pride being seen, and
begging for a drop of dew, to weep over it. The night bird, leaving its
solitary retreat in the hollow of the old tree, disturbs the melancholy
of the forests....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, no! Do not sing!&rdquo;
exclaimed the <i>alfereza</i> in perfect Tagalog and raising to her
feet somewhat agitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sing! Those verses hurt
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demented woman stopped. The orderly muttered &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
and exclaimed &ldquo;She knows how to <i>pat&aacute;</i>
Tagalog!&rdquo; and stood looking at the se&ntilde;ora full of
surprise.</p>
<p>The Muse understood that she had been caught, and was ashamed. As
her nature was not that of a woman, her shame took the form of rage and
hatred. She pointed out the door to the impudent orderly and with a
kick closed it behind him. She took several turns about the room,
twisting a whip between her nervous hands, and then, stopping suddenly
in front of the demented woman, said in Spanish:
&ldquo;Dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demented one did not move.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dance! Dance!&rdquo; she repeated
in a threatening voice.</p>
<p>The poor woman looked at the Se&ntilde;ora, her eyes devoid of
expression. The <i>alfereza</i> raised one arm and then the other,
shaking them in a menacing way.</p>
<p>She then leaped up in the air, and jumped around urging the other
woman to imitate her. The band in the procession could be heard playing
a slow, majestic march, but the Se&ntilde;ora, leaping about furiously
was keeping time to different music than that the band was playing,
that music which resounded within her. A curious look appeared in the
madwoman&rsquo;s eyes, and a weak smile moved her pale lips. She liked
the Se&ntilde;ora&rsquo;s dancing.</p>
<p>The <i>alfereza</i> stopped dancing as if ashamed. She raised the
whip, that terrible whip made in Ulango and improved by the
<i>alferez</i> by winding wire around it, that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>same
terrible whip which the <i>ladrones</i> and soldiers knew so well.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now it is your turn to dance ...
dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she began to whip lightly the demented woman&rsquo;s bare
feet.</p>
<p>The pale face contracted with pain, and she was obliged to defend
herself from the blows by her hands.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come! Go ahead!&rdquo; she
exclaimed with savage delight, and she passed from <i>lento</i> to
<a id="xd21e3583" name="xd21e3583"></a><i>allegro-vivace</i> in the use
of her whip.</p>
<p>The unhappy woman screamed and quickly raised her feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have got to dance, you
d&mdash;&mdash;d Indian!&rdquo; exclaimed the Se&ntilde;ora and the
whip whizzed and whistled.</p>
<p>The woman let herself sink to the floor and tried to cover her legs
with her hands, at the same time looking with wild eyes at her
tormentor. Two heavy <span class="corr" id="xd21e3593" title=
"Source: lashs">lashes</span> on her back made her rise again. Now it
was no longer a scream; it was a howl which escaped from the
unfortunate woman. The thin shirt was torn, the skin broke open and the
blood oozed out.</p>
<p>The sight of blood excites a tiger; so, too, the sight of the blood
of her victim infuriated Do&ntilde;a Consolacion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dance! dance! Curse you!
D&mdash;&mdash;n you! Dance! Cursed be the mother who bore you!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Dance, or I&rsquo;ll kill you by whipping you to
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the <i>alfereza</i>, taking the woman with one hand and
whipping her with another, began to jump and dance.</p>
<p>The insane woman understood her at last and went on moving her arms
regardless of time or tune. A smile of satisfaction contracted the lips
of the teacher. It was like the smile of a female Mephistopheles who
had succeeded in developing a good pupil; it was full of hatred,
contempt, mockery and cruelty; a coarse laugh could not have expressed
more.</p>
<p>Absorbed in the enjoyment which the spectacle afforded her, she did
not hear her husband coming, until he opened the door with a kick.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> appeared, pale and gloomy. He saw what was going
on there and looked daggers at his wife. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>did
not move from her tracks and stood smiling in a cynical way.</p>
<p>In the gentlest manner possible, he put his hand on the shoulder of
the dancing woman and made her stop. The demented woman sighed and
slowly sat down on the blood-covered floor.</p>
<p>The silence continued. The <i>alferez</i> was breathing heavily. His
wife was observing him with her questioning eyes. She seized the whip
and in a calm and measured tone asked him: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with you? You have not said &lsquo;good evening&rsquo; to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i>, without replying, called the orderly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take this woman,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and have Marta give her another shirt and take care of her. Find
her good food, and a good bed.... Let him look out who treats her
badly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After carefully closing the door, he turned the key in the lock and
approached his se&ntilde;ora.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You want me to smash you?&rdquo;
he said, clenching his fists.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
you?&rdquo; asked she, retreating a step or two.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
me?&rdquo; he shouted, in a thundering voice, and, giving vent to an
oath, showed her a paper covered with scribbling. He continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you write this letter
to the <i>Alcalde</i>, saying that I am paid for permitting the
gambling, d&mdash;&mdash;n you? I don&rsquo;t know how I can keep from
smashing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go ahead! Try it if you
dare!&rdquo; said she, with a mocking smile. &ldquo;He who smashes me
has got to be more of a man than you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the insult, but he saw the whip. He seized one of the
plates which were on the table and threw it at her head. The woman,
accustomed to these fights, ducked quickly and the plate was shivered
to pieces against the wall. A glass, a cup, and a knife shared the same
fortune.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;You dare not come near me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she spat at him to exasperate him more. The man, blind and
howling with rage, threw himself on her, but she, with wonderful
rapidity, struck him a few blows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>across the face with the
whip, and quickly escaped. Closing the door of her room with a slam,
she locked herself in. Roaring with rage and pain the <i>alferez</i>
followed her, but, coming up against the door, he could do nothing but
belch forth a string of blasphemies.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cursed be your ancestors, you
swine! Open, d&mdash;&mdash;n you! Open that door or I&rsquo;ll break
your skull!&rdquo; he howled, pounding and kicking the panels.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion did not reply. A moving of chairs and trunks
could be heard, as though some one was trying to raise a barricade of
household furniture. The house fairly shook with the oaths and kicks of
the husband.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you come in!
Don&rsquo;t you come in!&rdquo; she said, in a bitter voice. &ldquo;If
you show yourself, I&rsquo;ll shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband calmed down, little by little, and contented himself
with pacing from one end of the <i>sala</i> to the other like a wild
animal in its cage.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go and cool your head!&rdquo;
continued the woman in mockery. She seemed to have concluded her
preparations for defense.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I swear that when I catch you, no
one&mdash;not even God&mdash;will see you again! I&rsquo;ll smash you
so fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes! Now you can say what you
wish. You would not let me go to mass. You would not let me fulfill my
duty to God!&rdquo; she said with such sarcasm as she alone knew how to
use.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> took his helmet, straightened out his clothes,
and walked away several paces. But, at the end of several minutes, he
returned without making the slightest noise, for he had taken off his
boots. The servants, accustomed to these spectacles, paid no attention
to them, but the novelty of this move with the boots attracted their
notice and they gave each other the wink.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> sat down on a chair next to the door and had the
patience to wait more than half an hour.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you really gone out or are
you there, you he-goat?&rdquo; asked a voice from time to time,
changing the epithets but raising the tone.</p>
<p>Finally, she commenced to take away the furniture from her
barricade. He heard the noise and smiled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Orderly! Has the se&ntilde;or gone
out?&rdquo; cried Do&ntilde;a Consolacion.</p>
<p>The orderly at a signal from the <i>alferez</i>, replied:
&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;ora, he has gone out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could hear her laugh triumphantly. She drew back the bolt. The
husband arose to his feet slowly; the door was opened.</p>
<p>A cry, the noise of a body falling, oaths, howling, swearing, blows,
hoarse voices. Who can describe what took place in the darkness of the
bedroom?</p>
<p>The orderly, going out to the kitchen, made a very expressive
gesture to the cook.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ll catch
it!&rdquo; said the latter.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I? No, sir. The town will, not I.
She asked me if he had gone out, not if he had returned.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Might and Right.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was about ten o&rsquo;clock at night. The last
rockets lazily soared into the dark sky, where paper balloons shone
like new stars. Some of the fireworks had set fire to houses and were
threatening them with destruction; for this reason men could be seen on
the ridges of the roofs carrying buckets of water and long bamboo poles
with cloths tied on the ends. Their dark shadows seemed descended from
ethereal space to be present at the rejoicings of human beings. An
enormous number of wheels had been burned, also castles, bulls,
<i>caraboas</i> and other pieces of fireworks, and finally a great
volcano, which surpassed in beauty and grandeur anything that the
inhabitants of San Diego had ever seen.</p>
<p>Now the people turned in one great crowd toward the plaza to attend
the last theatrical performance. Here and there could be seen the
colored Bengal lights, fantastically illuminating groups of merry
people. The small boys were making use of their torches to search for
unexploded firecrackers in the grass, or, in fact, for anything else
that might be of use to them. But the music was the signal and all
abandoned the lawn for the theatre.</p>
<p>The large platform was splendidly illuminated. Thousands of lights
surrounded the pillars and hung from the roof, while a number, in
pyramid-shaped groups, were arranged on the floor of the stage. An
employee attended to these and whenever he would come forward to
regulate them, the public would whistle at him and shout: &ldquo;There
he is! There he is now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In front of the stage, the orchestra tuned its instruments,
and<a id="xd21e3725" name="xd21e3725"></a> behind the musicians sat the
principal people of the town. Spaniards and rich visitors were
occupying the reserved chairs. The public, the mass of people without
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>titles or rank, filled the rest of the plaza.
Some carried with them benches, not so much for seats as to remedy
their lack of stature. When they stood upon them, rude protests were
made on the part of those without benches or things to stand on. Then
they would get down immediately, but soon mount up on their pedestals
again as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Comings and goings, cries, exclamations, laughter, squibs that had
been slow in going off, and firecrackers increased the tumult. Here, a
foot broke through a bench, and some one fell to the floor, while the
crowd laughed and made a show of him who had come so far to see a show.
There, they fought and disputed over positions, and, a little farther
on, the noise of breaking bottles and glasses could be heard: it was
Andeng. She was carrying drinks and refreshments on a tray which she
was balancing with both hands, but she had met her lover and he tried
to take advantage of her helplessness by tickling....</p>
<p>The <i>teniente mayor</i> presided at the production since the
<i>gobernadorcillo</i> was fonder of <i>monte</i>.</p>
<p>Maria Clara and her friends had arrived, and Don Filipo received
them, and accompanied them to their seats. Behind came the curate with
another Franciscan and some Spaniards. With the curate were some other
people who make it their business to escort the friars.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May God reward them in another
life,&rdquo; said the old man, referring to them as he walked away from
Maria Clara&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>The performance began with Chananay and Marianito in
<i>Crispino&eacute; la Comare</i>. Everybody had eyes and ears intent
upon the stage, except one, Father Salv&iacute;. He seemed to have come
to the theatre for no other purpose than to watch Maria Clara, whose
sadness gave to her beauty an air so ideal and interesting that
everybody looked upon her with rapture. But the Franciscan&rsquo;s
eyes, deeply hidden in their hollow orbits, spoke no words of rapture.
In that sombre look one could read something desperately sad. With such
eyes Cain might have contemplated from afar the Paradise whose delights
his mother had pictured to him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>The act was just ending when Ibarra arrived. His presence occasioned
a buzz of conversation. The attention of everybody was fixed on him and
on the curate.</p>
<p>But the young man did not seem to be aware of it, for he greeted
Maria Clara and her friends with naturalness and sat down at their
side. The only one who spoke was Sinang.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you see the volcano when they
touched it off?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, my little friend. I had to
accompany the Governor General.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, that is too bad! The curate
came with us and he was telling us stories about condemned people. What
do you think? Doesn&rsquo;t he do it to make us afraid so that we
cannot enjoy ourselves? How does it appear to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate arose and approached Don Filipo, with whom he seemed to
be having a lively discussion. He was speaking with animation and Don
Filipo replying with moderation and in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am sorry that I cannot please
Your Reverence,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra is
one of the heaviest tax-payers and has a right to sit here as long as
he does not disturb the public order.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But is not scandalizing good
Christians disturbing the public order? You let a wolf into the flock.
You will be held responsible for this before God and before the
authorities of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I always hold myself responsible
for acts which emanate from my own will, Father,&rdquo; replied Don
Filipo, slightly inclining his head. &ldquo;But my little authority
does not give me power to meddle in religious affairs. Those who wish
to avoid contact with him do not have to speak to him. Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra does not force himself on any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But he affords danger. He who
loves danger perishes in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any danger,
Father. The <i>Alcalde</i> and the Governor General, my superiors, have
been talking with him all the afternoon, and it is not for me to give
them a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t put him out of
here, we will leave.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am very, very sorry, but I
cannot put any one out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate repented having said what he did, but now there was no
alternative. He made a signal to his companion, who laboriously rose to
his feet and both went out. The persons attached to the friars imitated
the priests, not, however, without first glancing with hatred at
Ibarra.</p>
<p>Murmurs and whispers increased. Then various persons approached and
saluted the young man and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We are with you. Take no notice of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who are
<i>&rsquo;them&rsquo;</i>?&rdquo; he asked with surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Those who have gone out in order
to avoid contact with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To avoid contact with me? Contact
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, they say that you are
excommunicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, surprised, did not know what to say and looked around him.
He saw Maria Clara, who was hiding her face behind her fan.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But is it possible?&rdquo; he
exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Are we still in the darkness of the Middle
Ages? So that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning to the young women and changing his tone, he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Excuse me; I have forgotten an
appointment. I will return to accompany you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Sinang.
&ldquo;Yeyeng is going to dance in the &lsquo;La Calandria.&rsquo; She
dances divinely.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I cannot, my little friend, but I
will certainly return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The murmurs increased.</p>
<p>While Yeyeng, dressed in the style of the lower class of Madrid, was
coming on the stage with the remark: &ldquo;<i lang="es">Da Ust&eacute;
su permiso?</i>&rdquo; (Do you give your permission?) and as Carvajal
was replying to her &ldquo;<i lang="es">Pase ust&eacute;
adelante</i>&rdquo; (Pass forward), two soldiers of the Civil Guard
approached Don Filipo, asking him to suspend the performance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what for?&rdquo; asked he,
surprised at the request.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because the <i>alferez</i> and his
Se&ntilde;ora have been fighting and they cannot sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You tell the <i>alferez</i> that
we have permission from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span><i>Alcalde</i>, and that no one in
the town has any authority over him, not even the
<i>gobernadorcillo</i>, who is my <i>on-ly su-per-ior</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, you will have to suspend the
performance,&rdquo; repeated the soldiers.</p>
<p>Don Filipo turned his back to them. The guards marched off.</p>
<p>In order not to disturb the general tranquillity, Don Filipo said
not a word about the matter to any one.</p>
<p>After a piece of light opera, which was heartily applauded, the
Prince Villardo presented himself on the stage, and challenged all the
Moros, who had imprisoned his father, to a fight. The hero threatened
to cut off all their heads at a single blow and to send them all to the
moon. Fortunately for the Moros, who were making ready to fight to the
tune of the &ldquo;Riego Hymn,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3855src" href="#xd21e3855" name="xd21e3855src">1</a> a tumult
intervened. All of a sudden, the orchestra stopped playing and the
musicians made a rush for the stage, throwing their instruments in all
directions. The brave Villardo was not expecting such a move, and,
taking them for allies of the Moros he also threw down his sword and
shield and began to run. The Moros, seeing this terrible giant fleeing,
found it convenient to imitate him. Cries, sighs, imprecations and
blasphemies filled the air. The people ran, trampled over each other,
the lights were put out, and the glass lamps with their cocoanut oil
and little wicks were flying through the air. &ldquo;<i>Tulisanes!
Tulisanes!</i>&rdquo; cried some. &ldquo;Fire! Fire!
<i>Ladrones!</i>&rdquo; cried others. Women and children wept, chairs
and spectators were rolled over on the floor in the midst of the
confusion, rush and tumult.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two Civil Guards with sticks in hand had gone after the musicians in
order to put an end to the spectacle. The <i>teniente mayor</i>, with
the <i>cuaderilleros</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3874src" href=
"#xd21e3874" name="xd21e3874src">2</a> armed with their old sabers, had
managed to arrest the two Civil Guards in spite of their resistance.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take them to the tribunal!&rdquo;
shouted Don Filipo. &ldquo;Be careful not to let them get
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra had returned and had sought out Maria Clara. The terrified
young maidens, trembling and pale, were clinging closely to him. Aunt
Isabel was reciting the litanies in Latin.</p>
<p>The crowd having recovered a little from the fright and some one
having explained what had caused the rush and tumult, indignation arose
in everyone&rsquo;s breast. Stones rained upon the Civil Guards who
were being conducted to the tribunal by the <i>cuaderilleros</i>. Some
one proposed that they burn the barracks of the Civil Guards and that
they roast Do&ntilde;a Consolacion and the <i>alferez</i> alive.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is all that they are good
for,&rdquo; cried a woman, rolling up her sleeves and stretching out
her arms. &ldquo;They can disturb the people but they persecute none
but honorable men. They do nothing with the <i>tulisanes</i> and the
gamblers. Look at them! Let us burn the <i>cuartel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody had been wounded in the arm and was asking for confession.
A plaintive voice was heard coming from under an upset bench. It was a
poor musician. The stage was filled with the players and people of the
town and they were all talking at the same time. There was Chananay,
dressed in the costume of Leonor in the &ldquo;Trovador,&rdquo; talking
in corrupted Spanish with Ratia, who was in a school teacher&rsquo;s
costume. There too, was Yeyeng, dressed in a silk wrapper, talking with
the Prince Villardo. There too, Balbino and the Moros, trying to
console the musicians who were more or less sorry sights. Some
Spaniards were walking from one place to another, arguing with every
one they met.</p>
<p>But a nucleus for a mob already formed. Don Filipo knew what was
their intention and tried to stop them.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not break the peace!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;To-morrow we will demand satisfaction: we will have
justice. I will take the responsibility for our getting
justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; some replied.
&ldquo;They did the same thing in Calamba. The same thing was promised,
but the <i>Alcalde</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>did nothing. We want justice done
by our own hands. To the <i>cuartel</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain the <i>teniente mayor</i> argued with them. The group that
had gathered showed no signs of changing its attitude or purpose. Don
Filipo looked about him, in search of help. He saw Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, for my sake,
as a favor, hold them while I seek some
<i>cuaderilleros</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; asked the
young man, perplexed. But the <i>teniente mayor</i> was already in the
distance.</p>
<p>Ibarra in turn looked about him, for he knew not whom. Fortunately,
he thought he discerned Elias, in the crowd, but not taking an active
part in it. Ibarra ran up to him, seized his arm and said to him in
Spanish:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake! Do
something, if you can! I cannot do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot must have understood, for he lost himself in the mob.</p>
<p>Lively discussions were heard mingled with strong interjections.
Soon the mob began to disperse, each one of the participants becoming
less hostile. And it was time for them to do so, for the
<i>cuaderilleros</i> were coming to the scene with fixed bayonets.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what was the curate doing?</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; had not gone to bed. Standing on foot, immovable
and leaning his face against the shutter, he was looking toward the
plaza and, from time to time, a suppressed sigh escaped his breast. If
the light of his lamp had not been so dim, perhaps one might have seen
that his eyes were filling with tears. Thus he stood for almost an
hour.</p>
<p>The tumult in the plaza roused him from this state. Full of
surprise, he followed with his eyes the people as they rushed to and
fro in confusion. Their voices and cries he could vaguely hear even at
that distance. One of the servants came running in breathlessly and
informed him what was going on.</p>
<p>A thought entered his mind. Amid confusion and tumult libertines
take advantage of the fright and the weakness of woman. All flee to
save themselves; nobody thinks of anyone else; the women faint and
their cries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>are not heard; they fall; are trampled over;
fear and fright overcome modesty, and under cover of darkness.... He
fancied he could see Ibarra carrying Maria Clara fainting in his arms,
and then disappearing in the darkness.</p>
<p>With leaps and bounds, he went down the stairs without hat, or cane,
and, almost like a crazy person, turned toward the plaza.</p>
<p>There he found some Spaniards reproving the soldiers. He looked
toward the seats which Maria Clara and her friends had been occupying,
and saw that they were vacant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father curate! Father
curate!&rdquo; shouted the Spaniards to him, but he took no notice and
ran on in the direction of the house of Captain Tiago. There he
recovered his breath. He saw through the transparent shade, a
shadow&mdash;that adorable shadow, so graceful and delicate in its
contour&mdash;that of Maria Clara. He could also see another shadow,
that of her aunt carrying cups and glasses.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he muttered to
himself. &ldquo;It seems that she has only fallen ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel afterward closed the shell windows and the graceful
shadow could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>The curate walked away from there without seeing the crowd. He was
looking at the bust of a beautiful maiden which he had before his eyes,
a maiden sleeping and breathing sweetly. Her eyelids were shaded by
long lashes, which formed graceful curves like those on Rafael&rsquo;s
virgins. Her small mouth was smiling, and her whole countenance seemed
to breathe virginity, purity and innocence. That sweet face of hers on
the background of the white draperies of the bed was a vision like the
head of a cherubim among the clouds. His impassioned imagination went
on and pictured to him.... Who can describe all that a burning brain
can conceive? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=

<p class="first">Ibarra found his mind in such a state that it was
impossible for him to sleep. So, in order to divert himself and to
drive away the gloomy idea which distracted his mind, he began work in
his solitary laboratory. Morning came upon him, still at work making
mixtures and compounds to the action of which he submitted pieces of
cane and other substances, and afterward enclosed them in numbered and
sealed flasks.</p>
<p>A servant entered, announcing the arrival of a peasant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let him enter!&rdquo; said he,
without even turning to look.</p>
<p>Elias entered and remained standing in silence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! is it you?&rdquo; Ibarra
exclaimed in Tagalog on recognizing him. &ldquo;Excuse me if I have
kept you waiting. I was not aware of your presence. I was making an
important experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not wish to disturb
you!&rdquo; replied the young pilot. &ldquo;I have come in the first
place, to ask you if you want anything from the province of Batangas,
whither I am going now; and, in the second place, to give you some bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked inquiringly at the pilot.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The daughter of Captain Tiago is
ill,&rdquo; added Elias quietly, &ldquo;but the illness is not
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I had already feared it,&rdquo;
responded Ibarra. &ldquo;Do you know what the illness is?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A fever. Now, if you have nothing
to order&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thanks, my friend. I wish you a
good journey, but before you go, permit me to ask you a question. If it
is indiscreet, do not answer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias bowed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How were you able to quiet the mob
last night?&rdquo; asked Ibarra, fixing his eyes on him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In a very simple way,&rdquo;
replied Elias, with entire frankness. &ldquo;At the head of it were two
brothers whose father died from the effects of a whipping at the hands
of the Civil Guard. One day I had the fortune to save them from the
same hands into which their father fell, and for this both are under
obligations to me. Last night I went to them, and requested them to
dissuade the others from their purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And those two brothers whose
father died by being whipped to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They will end their lives in the
same way,&rdquo; replied Elias in a low voice. &ldquo;When adversity
has marked itself once on a family, all the members have to perish.
When the lightning strikes a tree, it reduces it all to
ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Elias, seeing that Ibarra was silent, took his leave.</p>
<p>The latter on finding himself alone, lost the serenity of
countenance which he had preserved in the presence of the pilot, and
grief manifested itself in his face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&mdash;I have made her
suffer,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He quickly dressed himself and descended the stairs.</p>
<p>A little man, dressed in mourning, with a large scar on his left
cheek, meekly saluted him, stopping him on his way.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; Ibarra
asked him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, my name is Lucas. I
am the brother of the man who was killed yesterday during the ceremony
when the stone was being laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! You have my
sympathy&mdash;and, well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, I wish to know how
much you are going to pay my brother&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How much I am going to pay?&rdquo;
repeated the young man without being able to conceal a bored
expression. &ldquo;We will talk that over. Come back this afternoon,
for I am busy to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Only tell me how much you are
going to pay,&rdquo; insisted Lucas.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have told you that we would talk
about that some other time. I&rsquo;m too busy to-day,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, impatiently. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147"
name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t time now,
se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; asked Lucas with bitterness and putting himself in
front of the young man. &ldquo;You do not have time to occupy yourself
about the dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come this afternoon, my good
fellow!&rdquo; repeated Ibarra, restraining himself. &ldquo;To-day I
have to go and see a sick person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! and you forget the dead for a
sick person? Do you think that because we are
poor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him and cut off what he was saying.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try my
patience!&rdquo; said he, and went on his way. Lucas stood looking at
him, with a smile on his face, full of hatred.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You do not know that you are a
grandson of the man who exposed my father to the sun!&rdquo; he
muttered between his teeth. &ldquo;You have the very same blood in your
veins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, changing his tone he added:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But if you pay well, we are
friends.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXIV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Episode in Espada&ntilde;a&rsquo;s Life.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The festival was over. The citizens found, just as
every year, that their treasury was poorer, that they had worked,
perspired, and stayed up nights without enjoying themselves, without
acquiring new friends, and in a word, had paid dearly for the noise and
their headaches. But it did not matter. The next year they would do the
same thing, and the same for the coming century, just as had always
been the custom to the present time.</p>
<p>Enough sadness reigned in Captain Tiago&rsquo;s house. All the
windows were closed; the people scarcely made a noise, and no one dared
to speak except in the kitchen. Maria Clara, the soul of the house, lay
sick in her bed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you think, Isabel? Shall I
make a donation to the cross of Tunasan or to the cross of
Matahong?&rdquo; asked the solicitous father in a low voice. &ldquo;The
cross of <span class="corr" id="xd21e4060" title=
"Source: Tunason">Tunasan</span> grows, but that of Matahong sweats.
Which do you think is the most miraculous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isabel thought for a moment, moved her head and murmured: &ldquo;To
grow&mdash;to grow is more miraculous than to sweat. We all sweat, but
we do not all grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is true, yes, Isabel, but
bear in mind that for wood to sweat when it is made into the leg of a
chair is no small miracle. Well, the best thing to do is to give alms
to both crosses, so that neither will feel resentful, and Maria Clara
will recover more quickly. Are the rooms in good order? You know that a
new se&ntilde;or comes with the doctors, a relative of Father
D&aacute;maso by marriage. It is necessary that nothing be
lacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cousins, Sinang and Victoria, were at the other end of the
dining-room. They had come to keep company with the sick Maria. Andeng
was helping them clean up a tea service in order to serve tea.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know Doctor
Espada&ntilde;a?&rdquo; asked Maria Clara&rsquo;s foster sister,
directing her question to Victoria.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the latter.
&ldquo;The only thing that I know about him is that he charges very
dearly, according to Captain Tiago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then he ought to be very
good,&rdquo; said Andeng. &ldquo;The one who performed the operation on
the stomach of Do&ntilde;a Marta charged a big price, but he was very
wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You goose!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sinang. &ldquo;Not all who charge high prices are wise. Look at Doctor
Guevara. He did not know how to aid a woman in childbirth, but after
cutting off the child&rsquo;s head, he collected one hundred
<i>pesos</i> from the widower. What he did know was how to
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;
her cousin asked, giving her a jab with her elbow.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I know about
it? The husband, who is a wood-sawyer, after losing his wife, had to
lose his house also, for the <i>Alcalde</i> was a friend of the
doctor&rsquo;s and made him pay. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I know? My father
loaned him money so that he could make a trip to Santa Cruz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A coach stopped before the house and cut off all the
conversation.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago, followed by Aunt Isabel, ran downstairs to receive
the new arrivals. They were the doctor, Don Tiburcio de
Espada&ntilde;a, his wife, Doctora Do&ntilde;a Victorina de los Reyes
<i>de</i> de Espada&ntilde;a; and a young Spaniard. The latter had a
sympathetic face and a pleasing appearance.</p>
<p>The <i>doctora</i> wore a silk gown, embroidered with flowers, and
on her hat, a large parrot half crushed among trimmings of red and blue
ribbons. The dust of the road had mingled with the rice powder on her
cheeks, strongly accentuating her wrinkles. She was leaning on the arm
of her lame husband.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have the pleasure to present to
you our cousin, Don Alfonso Linares de Espada&ntilde;a,&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, pointing toward the young man. &ldquo;The
gentleman is a god-son of a relative of Father D&aacute;maso, and is
private secretary to all the ministers.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young man bowed gracefully. Captain Tiago almost kissed his
hand.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina was a woman of about forty-five summers,
which, according to her arithmetical calculations, was equivalent to
thirty-two springs. She had been pretty in her youth, but, raging over
her own beauty, she had looked with disdain on many Filipino adorers,
for her aspirations were for the other race. She had not cared to
entrust her little white hand to anybody, but this not on account of
lack of confidence on her part, for she had entrusted rings and jewels
of inestimable value to various foreign adventurers.</p>
<p>Six months before the time of the happenings of which we are
writing, she saw her beautiful dream realized, that dream of her whole
life, on account of which she had disdained all manner of flattery and
even the promises of love, which had been cooed into her ears, or sung
in serenades by Captain Tiago. Late, it is true, she had realized her
dream; but she knew well the proverb&mdash;&ldquo;Better late than
never,&rdquo; and consoled herself by repeating it again and again.
&ldquo;There is no complete happiness on this earth,&rdquo; was her
other favorite proverb, but neither of these ever passed her lips in
the presence of other people.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina, after passing her first, second, third and
fourth youth in fishing in the sea of men for the object of her dreams,
had at last to content herself with what fortune cared to give her. The
poor little woman, if she, instead of having passed thirty-two springs,
had not passed more than thirty-one&mdash;the difference according to
her arithmetic was very great&mdash;would have thrown back the prize
which Destiny offered her, and preferred to wait for another more in
conformity with her tastes. But, as the man proposed and necessity
disposed it so, for she needed a husband very badly, she was compelled
to content herself with a poor man, who had been driven by necessity to
leave the Province of Estremadura in Spain. He, after wandering about
the world for six or seven months, a modern Ulysses, found at last in
the island of Luzon, hospitality, money, and a faded Calypso, his
better half&mdash;but alas! a bitter half. He was known as the unhappy
Tiburcio Espada&ntilde;a, and, although he was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>thirty-five years old and seemed even older, he
was, however, younger than Do&ntilde;a Victorina, who was only
thirty-two.</p>
<p>He had come to the Philippines in the capacity of clerk in the
custom house, but after all the sea-sickness of the voyage and after
fracturing a leg on the way, he had the bad luck to receive his
discharge fifteen days after his arrival. He was left without a single
<i>cuarto</i>.</p>
<p>Distrusting the sea, he did not wish to return to Spain without
having made a fortune. So he decided to devote himself to something.
Spanish pride did not permit him to do any manual labor. The poor man
would have worked with pleasure to have earned an honorable living, but
the prestige of the Spaniard did not permit this, nor did that prestige
provide him with the necessities of life.</p>
<p>At first he lived at the expense of some of his countrymen, but, as
Tiburcio had some self-respect, the bread was sour to him, and instead
of getting fat he grew thin. As he had neither knowledge of any
science, money nor recommendations, his countrymen, in order to get rid
of him, advised him to go to some of the provinces and pass himself off
as a Doctor of Medicine. At first, he did not like the idea, and
opposed the plan, for although he had been a servant in the San Carlos
Hospital, he had not learned anything about the science of healing, his
duty having been to dust off the benches and light the fires, and, even
in this work, he had served only a short time. But as necessity was
pressing him hard, and as his friends pointed out the vanity of his
scruples, he took their advice, went into the provinces and began to
visit the sick, charging as much for his services as his conscience
permitted. Later on he began to charge dearly and to put a high price
on his visits. On this account, he was at once taken to be a great
doctor and would probably have made his fortune, had not the attention
of the Protective Medical Society of Manila, been called to his
exorbitant charges and to his harmful competition.</p>
<p>Private citizens and professors interceded in his behalf.
&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; said the zealous Doctor C. in speaking of him.
&ldquo;Let him make his little money. Let him make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>his
little six or seven thousand <i>pesos</i>. He will be able to return to
his native land then and live in peace. What does it matter to you? Let
him deceive the unwary natives. Then they may become smarter. He is a
poor, unhappy fellow. Do not take the bread from his mouth. Be a good
Spaniard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor C. was a good Spaniard and he winked at the matter. But when
the facts reached the ears of the people, they began to lose confidence
in him, and little by little Don Tiburcio Espada&ntilde;a lost his
clientage, and found himself almost obliged to beg for bread day by
day. Then it was that he learned from a friend of his, who was also a
friend of Do&ntilde;a Victorina about the position of that woman, and
about her patriotism and good heart. Don Tiburcio saw in her a bit of
blue sky and asked to be presented.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina and Don Tiburcio met. <i lang="la">Tarde
venientibus ossa</i>, he would have exclaimed if he had known Latin.
She was no longer passable, she was past. Her abundant hair had been
reduced to a wad about the size of an onion top, as the servants were
wont to describe it. Her face was full of wrinkles and her teeth had
begun to loosen. Her eyes had also suffered, and considerably, too. She
had to squint frequently when she cared to look off at a certain
distance. Her character was the only thing that had remained
unchanged.</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour&rsquo;s conversation, they came to an
understanding and accepted each other. She would have preferred a
Spaniard less lame, less of a stammerer, less bald, one with more
teeth, one of more rank and social standing, or
<i>categor&iacute;a</i>, as she called it. But this class of Spaniards
never came to ask her hand. She had heard, too, more than once that
&ldquo;opportunity is bald,&rdquo; and she honestly believed that Don
Tiburcio was that very opportunity, for on account of his dark days he
had prematurely lost his hair. What woman is not prudent at
thirty-two?</p>
<p>Don Tiburcio, for his part, felt a vague melancholy when he thought
of his honeymoon. He smiled with resignation especially when he called
the phantom of hunger to his aid. He had never had ambition or
pretensions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>His tastes were simple, his thoughts limited;
but his heart, untouched till then, had dreamed of a very different
divinity. In his youth when, tired by his day&rsquo;s labor, after a
frugal meal, he lay down on a poor bed, he dreamed of a smiling,
affectionate image. Afterward, when his sorrows and privations
increased, the years passed and his poetical dreams were not fulfilled,
he thought merely of a good woman, a willing hand, a worker, who might
afford him a small dowry, console him when tired from labor, and
quarrel with him from time to time. Yes, he was thinking of the
quarrels as a happiness! But when, obliged to wander from country to
country, in search no longer of a fortune, but of some commodity to
sustain his life for the remainder of his days; when, deluded by the
accounts of his countrymen who came from beyond the seas, he embarked
for the Philippines&mdash;then the vision of a housekeeper gave way to
an image of an arrogant <i>mestiza</i>, a beautiful native with large
black eyes, draped in silks and transparent garments, loaded with
diamonds and gold, offering him her love and her carriages.</p>
<p>He arrived in the Philippines and believed that he was about to
realize his dream, for the young women who, in silver-plated carriages,
frequented the Luneta and the Malecon, Manila&rsquo;s popular and
fashionable drives, looked at him with a certain curiosity. Later, when
this curiosity on their part had ceased, the <i>mestiza</i> disappeared
from his dreams, and with great labor he formed in his mind a picture
of a widow, but an agreeable widow. So it was that when he saw only
part of his dream taking on real form, he became sad. But he was
somewhat of a philosopher and said to himself: &ldquo;That was a dream,
but in the world one does not live in dreams.&rdquo; Thus he settled
all his doubts; she wasted a lot of rice powder on her cheeks. Pshaw!
When they were once married he would make her stop that easily enough;
she had many wrinkles in her face, but his coat had more bare spots and
patches; she was old, pretentious, and imperious, but hunger was more
imperious, and still more pretentious; and then, too, he had a sweet
disposition, and, who could tell?&mdash;love modifies character; she
spoke Spanish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>very badly, but he himself did not speak it
well; at least, the head of the Customs department had so notified him
in his discharge from his position, and besides, what did it matter?
What if she was old and ridiculous? He was lame, toothless and bald.
When some friend jested with him, he would respond: &ldquo;Give me
bread and call me a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Tiburcio was what is vulgarly called a man who would not harm a
fly. He was modest and incapable of conceiving an evil thought. He
would have made a good missionary had he lived in olden times. His stay
in the country had not given him that conviction of his own
superiority, of his own worth, and of his high importance, which the
larger part of his countrymen acquire in a few weeks in the
Philippines. His heart had never been able to conceive hatred for
anybody or anything. He had not yet been able to find a revolutionist.
He only looked upon the people as unhappy beings whom it was fitting
for him to deprive of a little of their wealth in order to prevent
himself becoming even more unhappy than they. When they tried to make a
case against him for passing as a doctor without a proper license, he
did not resent it, he did not complain. He saw the justice of the case,
and only replied: &ldquo;But it is necessary to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were married and went to Santa A&ntilde;a to pass their
honeymoon. But on the night of the wedding Do&ntilde;a Victorina had a
bad attack of indigestion. Don Tiburcio gave thanks to God and showed
solicitude and care. On the second night, however, he conducted himself
like an honorable man, but on the day following, when he looked in the
mirror at his bare gums, he smiled with melancholy: he had grown ten
years older at least.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina, charmed with her husband, had a good set of
front teeth made for him, and had the best tailors in the city dress
and equip him. She ordered carriages and <i>calesas</i>, sent to
Batangas and Albay provinces for the finest spans of horses, and even
obliged him to make two entries in the coming horse races.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while she was transforming her husband, she did not
forget her own person. She laid aside the silk <i>saya</i> or Filipino
skirt and <i>pi&ntilde;a</i> cloth bodice, for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>a
dress of European style. She substituted false curls in front for the
simple hair dress of the Filipinos. Her dresses, which fitted her
&ldquo;divinely bad,&rdquo; disturbed the peace and tranquillity of the
entire neighborhood.</p>
<p>The husband never went out of the house afoot&mdash;she did not want
people to see that he was lame. He always took her for drives through
the places most deserted, much to her pain, for she wanted to display
her husband on the drives most frequented by the public. But out of
respect for their honeymoon, she kept silent.</p>
<p>The last quarter of the honeymoon had just begun when he wanted to
stop her from using rice powder on her cheeks, saying to her that it
was false and not natural. Do&ntilde;a Victorina frowned and looked
squarely at his front set of teeth. He at once became silent, and she
learned his weakness.</p>
<p>She soon got the idea that she was to become a mother and made the
following announcement to all her friends: &ldquo;Next month, we, I and
de Espada&ntilde;a are going to the <i>Pe&ntilde;insula</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4186src" href="#xd21e4186" name="xd21e4186src">1</a>
I don&rsquo;t want to have my son born here and have them call him a
revolutionist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added a <i>de</i> to her husband&rsquo;s name. The <i>de</i> did
not cost anything and gave <i>categor&iacute;a</i> to the name. When
she signed herself, she wrote Victorina de los Reyes de de
Espada&ntilde;a. That <i>de</i> de Espada&ntilde;a was her mania.
Neither the lithographer who printed her cards, nor her husband, could
get the idea out of her head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I do not put more than one
<i>de</i> in the name people will think that I haven&rsquo;t it,
fool!&rdquo; said she to her husband.</p>
<p>She was talking continually about her preparations for the voyage to
Spain. She learned by memory the names of the points where the steamers
called, and it was a pleasure to hear her talk&mdash;&ldquo;I am going
to see the <i>sismus</i> of the Suez Canal. De Espada&ntilde;a thinks
that it is the most beautiful, and De Espada&ntilde;a has seen the
whole world.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I will probably never return to this
land of savages.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was not born to live here. Aden
or Port Said would be more suitable for me. I have always <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>thought so since I was a child.&rdquo;
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, in her geography, divided the world into two
parts, the Philippines and Spain. In this she differed from the lower
class of people in Madrid for they divide it into Spain and America, or
Spain and China, America and China being merely different names for the
same country.</p>
<p>The husband knew that some of these things were barbarisms, but he
kept silent so that she would not mock him and twit him with his
stammering. She feigned to be whimsical in order to increase her
illusion that she was a mother, and she began to dress herself in
colors, adorn herself with flowers and ribbons, and to walk through the
Escolta in a wrapper. But oh! what an illusion! Three months passed and
the dream vanished. By this time, having no fear that her son would be
a revolutionist, she gave up the voyage. She consulted doctors,
mid-wives and old women, but all in vain. To the great displeasure of
Captain Tiago she made fun of San Pascual Bailon, as she did not care
to run to any saint. On account of this a friend of her <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4217" title="Source: huband">husband</span> told
her:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Believe me, Se&ntilde;ora, you are
the only <i lang="es">espiritu fuerte</i> (strong-minded person) in
this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled without understanding what <i lang="es">espiritu
fuerte</i> meant, but, at night, when it was time to be sleeping, she
asked her husband about it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; replied he,
&ldquo;the e&mdash;espir&mdash;espiritu most fu-fuerte that I
know&mdash;know about is a&mdash;a&mdash;ammonia. My fr-fr-friend must
have be-been us-using a figure of rhetoric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time on, she was always saying, whenever she could,
&ldquo;I am the only ammonia in this country, speaking rhetorically, as
Se&ntilde;or N. de N. who is from the <i>Pe&ntilde;insula</i> and who
has much <i>categor&iacute;a</i>, puts it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever she said had to be done. She had come to dominate her
husband completely. On his part, he offered no great resistance, and
was converted into a little lap dog for her. If he incommoded her she
would not let him go out for a drive, and when she became really
infuriated, she would snatch out his false teeth and leave <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>him
a horrible-looking man for one or more days, according to the
offense.</p>
<p>It occurred to her that her husband ought to be a Doctor of Medicine
and Surgery, and so she expressed herself to him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Daughter! Do you want them to
arrest me?&rdquo; he said, frightened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool. Let me
arrange it!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You are not going to attend any
one, but I want them to call you a doctor and me a <i>doctora</i>,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on the following day Rodoreda, a prominent marble dealer in
Manila, received an order for the following engraving on black marble:
<span class="sc">Dr. De Espada&ntilde;a, Specialist in All Kinds of
Diseases.</span></p>
<p>All of the servants had to give them their new titles, and, in
consequence of it all, she increased the number of her curls in front,
the layer of rice powder, the ribbons and laces, and looked with more
disdain than ever on the poor and less fortunate women of her country,
who had less <i>categor&iacute;a</i> than she. Each day she felt
herself more dignified and elevated, and, following along this road, in
less than a year she would think herself of divine origin.</p>
<p>These sublime thoughts, however, did not prevent her from growing
more ridiculous and older each day. Every time that Captain Tiago met
her in the street and remembered that he had once made love to her in
vain, he would go at once to the church and give a <i>peso</i> for a
mass as a thank offering for his good luck in not marrying her. In
spite of this, Captain Tiago highly respected her husband, on account
of his title of &ldquo;specialist in all kinds of diseases,&rdquo; and
he listened with close attention to the few phrases that he managed to
stutter out. In fact, it was on account of this title and the fact that
the doctor did not attend everybody, that the Captain chose him to
attend his daughter.</p>
<p>As to the young man Linares, it is a different story. When she was
making ready for her voyage to Spain, Do&ntilde;a Victorina thought of
having an administrator from the <i>Pe&ntilde;insula</i> to look after
her affairs, for she did not trust Filipinos. Her husband remembered a
nephew in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>Madrid who was studying to become a lawyer, and
who was considered the smartest one in his family. They wrote to him,
then, sending him in advance money for the passage, and, when the dream
was dispelled, the young man was already on his way.</p>
<p>These are the three persons who had just arrived.</p>
<p>While they were eating their breakfast, Father Salv&iacute; arrived,
and, as the husband and wife had already met the friar, they presented
him to the young Linares, with all his titles. The young man
blushed.</p>
<p>As was natural they spoke of Maria Clara. The young maiden was
resting and sleeping. They talked over the voyage. Do&ntilde;a
Victorina showed her verbosity by criticising the customs of the
provinces, the <i>nipa</i> houses, the bamboo bridges, without
forgetting to tell the curate about her friendship with the Commander
of the Army, the <i>Alcalde</i> so and so, Judge so and so of the
Supreme Court, and with the governor of the province, all persons of
<i>categor&iacute;a</i>, who had much consideration for her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you had come two days before,
Dona Victorina,&rdquo; replied Captain Tiago during a short pause,
&ldquo;you would have met His Excellency, the Governor General. He sat
right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What? How&rsquo;s that? Was His
Excellency here? And in your house? A lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I tell you he sat right there. If
you had come two days before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! What a shame that little Clara
did not fall sick before!&rdquo; exclaimed she, in real sorrow. And
directing herself to Linares: &ldquo;Do you hear, cousin? His
Excellency was here! You see De Espada&ntilde;a was right when he told
you that we were not going to the house of a miserable native. For you
should know, Don Santiago, that our cousin was a friend of all the
Ministers in Madrid and all the Dukes, and he dined in the house of
Count del Campanario (belfry).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Duke de la Torre (tower),
Victorina,&rdquo; said her husband, correcting her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It amounts to the same thing. Do
you think you can tell me that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Would I find Father D&aacute;maso
in town to-day?&rdquo; interrupted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"
href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>Linares, turning to Father
Salv&iacute;. &ldquo;They have told me that he is near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is, precisely, and will come
here in a little while,&rdquo; replied the curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How glad I am! I have a letter for
him,&rdquo; exclaimed the young man. &ldquo;And if it had not been for
this happy chance which brought me here, I would have come expressly to
visit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The happy chance&mdash;that is,
Maria Clara&mdash;had, in the meantime awakened.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;De Espada&ntilde;a!&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, finishing her breakfast. &ldquo;Are we going to
see little Clara?&rdquo; And turning to Captain Tiago, &ldquo;For you
only, Don Santiago; for you alone! My husband does not treat anybody
except people of <i>categor&iacute;a</i>, and he even refuses some of
them! My husband is not like those about here&mdash;in Madrid he only
visited people of <i>categor&iacute;a</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed into the sick room.</p>
<p>The room was almost dark. The windows were shut for fear of a
draught, and the little light which illuminated the room came from the
two wax candles which were burning in front of an image of the Virgin
of Antipolo.</p>
<p>Her head wrapped up in a handkerchief, saturated in cologne water,
her body wrapped in wide folds of white sheets which outlined her
virginal form, the sick maiden lay on her bed of
<i>kamakon</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4331src" href="#xd21e4331"
name="xd21e4331src">2</a> among <i>jusi</i> and <i>pi&ntilde;a</i>
curtains. Her hair, forming a frame around her oval face, increased her
transparent paleness, which was animated only by her large eyes full of
sadness. At her side were her two friends and Andeng.</p>
<p>De Espada&ntilde;a felt of her pulse, examined her tongue, asked
some questions, and shaking his head seriously, said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sh-sh-she is si-sick. But we-we-we
can cu-cu-cure her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina looked with pride at those around her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A li-lichen in mil-milk in the-the
morning; syrup of marsh marsh-mal-mallow, tw-o&mdash;two
hounds&rsquo;&mdash;hounds&rsquo; tongue pi-pills,&rdquo; ordered De
Espada&ntilde;a. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take courage, little Clara,&rdquo;
said Do&ntilde;a Victorina, approaching her. &ldquo;We have come to
cure you. I am going to present our cousin to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linares was absorbed, contemplating those eloquent eyes which seemed
to be seeking some one, and he did not hear Do&ntilde;a Victorina call
him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Linares,&rdquo; said
the curate, calling him out of his ecstacy. &ldquo;Here comes Father
D&aacute;maso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, Father D&aacute;maso was coming, pale and somewhat sad. On
leaving his bed, his first visit was to Maria Clara. He was no longer
the Father D&aacute;maso that he had been, so robust and talkative. He
now walked along in silence and with unsteady footsteps. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Without paying attention to anybody, Father
D&aacute;maso went straight to the sick room and took hold of
Maria&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; said he, with
indescribable tenderness, as tears dropped from his eyes. &ldquo;Maria,
my child, you are not going to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria opened her eyes and looked at him with surprise.</p>
<p>None who knew the Franciscan suspected that he ever had such tender
thoughts. No one ever supposed that a heart existed under that gross
and rude aspect.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso could say no more and left the maiden, weeping
like a child. He went out through the room at the head of the stairs,
to give free vent to his grief, on Maria Clara&rsquo;s balcony under
her favorite vines.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How he loves his
god-daughter!&rdquo; thought they all.</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; witnessed the scene, immovable and silent,
lightly biting his lips.</p>
<p>When his grief was somewhat soothed, Father D&aacute;maso was
introduced by Do&ntilde;a Victorina to the young Linares, who
approached the friar with respect.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso gazed at him in silence from head to foot. He
took the letter which the young man handed to him and read it
apparently without understanding it, for he asked him:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Alfonso Linares, the god-son of
your brother-in-law,&rdquo; stammered the young man.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso leaned back and examined the young man again.
His face brightened up and he rose to his feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And so you are the god-son of
little Charles!&rdquo; he exclaimed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>&ldquo;Come here and
let me embrace you. It was some days ago that I received your letter.
So it is you! I did not know you&mdash;but that is easily explained,
for you were not yet born when I left the country. I never knew
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Father D&aacute;maso stretched out his robust arms to the young
man who blushed, either from shame or suffocation. Father D&aacute;maso
seemed to have completely forgotten his grief.</p>
<p>After the first moments of effusion had passed, and questions had
been asked about Carlicos, as he called little Charles, Father
D&aacute;maso asked:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well. What does Carlicos want me
to do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I believe he says something in the
letter,&rdquo; stammered Linares again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the letter? Let us see.
&rsquo;Tis so! And he wants me to get you a job and a wife! Hm!
Employment&mdash;employment: that is easy. Do you know how to read and
write?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have graduated in law from the
Central University.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Carambas!</i> So you are a
pettifogger? Well, you don&rsquo;t look it&mdash;you look more like a
young gentleman. But so much the better! But to find you a
wife&mdash;hm! hm! a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father, I am not in a hurry about
it,&rdquo; said Linares, confused.</p>
<p>But Father D&aacute;maso began to walk from one end of the room to
the other, muttering: &ldquo;A wife! A wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face by this time was no longer sad, nor was it cheerful. It
expressed the greatest seriousness and he seemed to be meditating.
Father Salv&iacute; surveyed the scene from a distance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I did not believe that it could
give me such pain,&rdquo; murmured Father D&aacute;maso in a mournful
voice. &ldquo;But of two evils the lesser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And raising his voice and approaching Linares, he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come here, my boy! We will speak
with Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linares turned pale and allowed himself to be led along by the
priest, who was deep in thought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then it was Father Salv&iacute;&rsquo;s turn to walk up and down the
room and he did so, meditating, as was his custom.</p>
<p>A voice bidding him good morning stopped his monotonous tread. He
raised his head and his eyes met Lucas, who saluted him humbly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked the
eyes of the curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father, I am the brother of the
man who was killed on the day of the <i>fiesta</i>,&rdquo; replied
Lucas, in a tearful tone.</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; stepped back.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what of it?&rdquo; he
muttered, in an unintelligible voice.</p>
<p>Lucas made an effort to weep, and dried his eyes with his
handkerchief.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, crying,
&ldquo;I have been to Crisostomo&rsquo;s house to ask him for
indemnity. At first, he received me with kicks, saying that he would
not pay anything, since he had run the risk of being killed through the
fault of my dear, unfortunate brother. Yesterday, I went to talk with
him again, but he had already left for Manila, leaving me for
charity&rsquo;s sake five hundred <i>pesos</i> for my poor
brother&mdash;five hundred <i>pesos</i>&mdash;ah! Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate listened to the first part of his story with surprise and
attention, but slowly there appeared on his lips a smile&mdash;a smile
of such contempt and sarcasm at the comedy that was being played, that
if Lucas had seen it he would have fled in all haste.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what do you want now?&rdquo;
he asked, turning his back to him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Alas! Father, for love of God tell
me what I ought to do. Father, you have always given good
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who has told you that? You do not
live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the whole province knows you,
Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; went up to him with his eyes full of anger and,
motioning to the street, said to the frightened Lucas:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go to your house and give thanks
to Don Crisostomo that he has not sent you to jail. Get away from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting his r&ocirc;le, Lucas muttered:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, I
thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Out of here!&rdquo; cried Father
Salv&iacute;, in a nervous tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I want to see Father
D&aacute;maso.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso is busy. Out
of here!&rdquo; ordered the curate, in an imperative tone, again.</p>
<p>Lucas went down the stairs murmuring: &ldquo;He is another. How
poorly he pays! He who pays better....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the curate had reached the ears of all in the house,
even Father D&aacute;maso, Captain Tiago and Linares.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;An insolent beggar who came to ask
alms and doesn&rsquo;t want to work,&rdquo; said Father Salv&iacute;,
taking his hat and cane and starting toward the convent. <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Persecuted.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By the dim light which the moon diffused through the
thick branches of the trees, a man wandered along the forest trails
slowly and cautiously. From time to time, as if to find out where he
was, he whistled a particular melody, to which another in the distance
responded with the same air. The man listened attentively, and
afterward proceeded in the direction of the distant sound.</p>
<p>Finally, passing through the thousand difficulties which a virgin
forest offers in the night time, he came to a small clearing. High
rocks, crowned with trees, surrounded the place, forming a sort of
ruined amphitheatre. Recently cut trees, with their charred trunks and
enormous rocks, which Nature had covered with her mantle of green
foliage, filled the middle of the open space.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the unknown man arrived, when another figure quickly
appeared from behind one of the large rocks, advanced and drew a
revolver.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked in
Tagalog and, in an imperious voice, as he cocked the hammer of his
weapon.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is old Pablo among you?&rdquo;
asked the first calmly, without replying to the question or becoming
intimidated.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you refer to the Captain? Yes,
he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell him, then, that Elias is
looking for him here,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you Elias?&rdquo; asked the
other with a certain respect, and <span class="corr" id="xd21e4506"
title="Source: aproaching">approaching</span> him without lowering his
revolver. &ldquo;Then come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias followed him.</p>
<p>They penetrated into a kind of cavern, which was hollowed out in the
depths of the earth. The guide, who knew the way, told the pilot when
he ought to get down, stoop or crawl. However, it was not long before
they came to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span><i>sala</i> or room in the cave, miserably
illuminated by pitch torches, and occupied by twelve or fifteen armed
men. The faces of the men were dirty and their clothes ragged; some
were sitting down, others lying down, conversing among themselves in a
low tone. Leaning his elbows on a stone which served as a table and
contemplating thoughtfully the lamp, which was shedding very little
light for the amount of smoke it made, sat an old man. His countenance
was sad, and his head wrapped in a bloody rag. If we had not known that
the place was a cave of <i>tulisanes</i>, we would have said, on
reading the desperation on the face of the old man, that it was the
Tower of Hunger on the eve when Ugolino devoured his sons.</p>
<p>At the arrival of Elias and the guide, the men were about to arise,
but, at a signal from the guide, they were quieted and contented
themselves with examining the pilot, who was entirely unarmed.</p>
<p>The old man turned his head slowly and his eyes met the sturdy
figure of Elias. The latter, in turn, with his head uncovered, full of
sadness and interest, gazed upon the old man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; asked the old
man, his face brightening a little as he recognized the youth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How badly off you are!&rdquo;
murmured Elias, in an half-intelligible tone of voice.</p>
<p>The old man bowed in silence, made a sign to the men, who then arose
and left, not, however, without first directing glances at the pilot,
measuring his stature and muscles.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the old man to
Elias as soon as they found themselves alone. &ldquo;Six months ago, I
gave you refuge in my house. Then, it was I who sympathized with you;
now, fortune has changed and it is you who pity me. But sit down, and
tell me how you came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Some fifteen days ago they told me
of your misfortune,&rdquo; replied the young man slowly, and in a low
voice, looking toward the light. &ldquo;I at once set out on the road
and I have been searching for you from mountain to mountain. I have
travelled over the greater part of two provinces.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Rather than spill innocent
blood,&rdquo; said Pablo, &ldquo;I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>had to flee. My
enemies are afraid to show themselves and shield themselves behind some
unhappy fellows who have never done me the slightest injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after a short pause, of which Elias took advantage to read the
thoughts in that melancholy countenance, he replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have come to make a proposition.
Having searched in vain for some member of the family which has caused
me my misfortunes, I have decided to leave the province where I am
living and to emigrate to the north and live there among the heathen
and independent tribes. Do you want to leave this life and go with me?
I will be your son, since you have lost those whom you had, and I, who
have no family, will take you as my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;At my age, when a person makes a
desperate resolution it is because there is no other course open. A man
who, like me has passed his youth and the best years of his life
working for his own future and for the future of his sons, a man who
has been submissive to all the wishes of his superiors, who has
discharged conscientiously all his duties, suffered everything in order
to live in peace and in tranquillity; when such a man, whose blood has
been chilled by Time, renounces all his past and all his future, on the
very edge of his grave&mdash;when a man does this, it is because he has
decided with mature judgment that peace does not exist, and that there
is no Supreme Good. What use is there in living a few miserable days in
a foreign land? I had two sons, a daughter, a fireside, a fortune. I
enjoyed consideration and esteem. Now I am like a tree that has been
stripped of its branches; a wandering fugitive, hunted like a wild
beast in the forest, and all&mdash;why? Because a man dishonored my
daughter, because her brothers wanted to make that man account for his
infamous deed, and because that man is placed above all others with a
title of Minister of God. But despite it all, I, a father, I,
dishonored in my old age, pardoned the injury, for I was indulgent with
the passions of youth and the weakness of the flesh, and, as the evil
was irreparable, I wanted to save what still remained to me. But the
criminal, afraid that vengeance was near at hand, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>sought the destruction of my sons. What did he
do? You do not know? Do you know how they feigned that there had been a
robbery in the convent and how one of my sons figured among the
accused? The other son they could not include because he was away. Do
you know the tortures to which they were submitted? You know them
because they are like those in other towns. I saw my son hung by the
hair, I heard his cries, I heard him call me, and, coward that I was,
and, accustomed to peace, I was not brave enough to kill or be killed.
Do you know that the robbery was not proved, that it was seen that it
was a calumny, that the curate was transferred to another town and that
my son died from the result of his tortures? The other boy, who was
still left for me, was not a coward like his father. The executioner
was afraid that this son would take revenge for the death of his
brother and so, under pretense of his not having a
<i>cedula</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4553src" href="#xd21e4553"
name="xd21e4553src">1</a> which for the moment had been forgotten, he
was imprisoned by the Civil Guard, maltreated, irritated and provoked
by force and injuries until he was driven to suicide. And I have
survived after such a disgrace. But, if I had not the courage of a
father to defend his sons, I have left a heart to take vengeance and I
shall be revenged! The discontented are uniting under my command, my
enemies increase my camp, and on that day when I consider myself strong
enough I will go down into the plain and extinguish in fire both my
vengeance and my own existence. And that day will come or there is no
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man rose to his feet deeply agitated. With his eyes
sparkling like fire and, in a hollow voice, he added, tearing his long
hair:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Curses upon me, curses upon me for
having restrained the avenging hand of my sons. I have assassinated
them! Had I allowed them to kill the criminal; had I had less faith in
the justice of God and of men, I would now have my sons; perhaps they
would have been fugitives, but I would have them and they would not
have died in torture. I was not born to be a father! For that reason, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>haven&rsquo;t them with me now! Curses upon me
for not having learned, with all my years, in what age we live! But in
blood and fire, and in my own death, I will know how to take vengeance
for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate father, in the paroxysm of his grief, had taken off
the bandage from his head, opening up a wound which he had on the
forehead and from which the blood oozed out.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I respect your grief,&rdquo;
replied Elias, &ldquo;and I understand your desire for vengeance. I,
too, am like you, but, for fear of harming an innocent one, I prefer to
forget my misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You can forget them because you
are young, and because you have not lost your son, have not lost your
last hope! But, I assure you, I will not harm an innocent person. Do
you see that wound? I allowed myself to receive that in order not to
kill a poor <i>cuaderillero</i> who was fulfilling his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; said Elias, after
a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;See what frightful destruction you
will bring upon our unfortunate country. If you seek revenge by your
own hand your enemies will retaliate, not against you, not against
those who are armed, but against the people, who are always accused,
and then how many more injustices!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let the people learn to defend
themselves. Let each learn to defend himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know that that is impossible.
Se&ntilde;or, I have known you in other times when you were happy, then
you gave me wise advice. Will you permit me...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man crossed his arms and seemed to meditate upon what he was
going to say.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; continued
Elias, measuring his words well, &ldquo;I have had the fortune to be of
service to a young man, rich, of good heart, noble, and a lover of his
country&rsquo;s welfare. They say that this young man has friends in
Madrid. I do not know it, but I can positively assure you that he is a
friend of the Governor General. What do you say if we make him the
bearer of the people&rsquo;s complaints, if we can interest him in the
cause of the unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you say that he is a rich man?
The rich think of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>nothing but to increase their riches. Pride
and pomp blind them, and, since they are generally well off, especially
if they have powerful friends, none of them ever troubles himself about
the unfortunates. I know it all, for I was once rich myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the man of whom I am speaking
does not seem to be like the others. He is a son who would not allow
the memory of his father to be dishonored. He is a young man who thinks
about the future&mdash;thinks of a good future for his sons, for he may
in a short time have a family of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then he is a man who is going to
be happy. Our cause is not a cause for happy men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But it is a cause for men of good
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; replied the
old man sitting down. &ldquo;Suppose that he consented to carry our
complaints to the Governor General. Suppose that he finds in the court
those who will argue for us. Do you think we will get
justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us try it before resorting to
bloody measures,&rdquo; replied Elias. &ldquo;It must seem strange to
you that I, another unfortunate, young, robust&mdash;that I should
propose to you old and weak&mdash;peaceful measures. But it is because
I have seen so many miseries caused by us similar to those caused by
tyrants. The unarmed is the one who suffers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if we do not accomplish
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Something will be accomplished,
believe me! Not all who govern are unjust. And if we do not accomplish
anything, if our voice is not listened to, if the man turns a deaf ear
to the grief of his fellow men, then we will put ourselves under your
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, full of enthusiasm, embraced the young man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I accept your proposition, Elias.
I know that you will keep your word. You come to me and I will help you
take vengeance for your father. You will help me to take vengeance for
my sons&mdash;my sons who were like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the meantime, Se&ntilde;or,
avoid all violent measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You can expound the complaints of
the people. You certainly know them. When will we know the
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Within four days send a man to
meet me on the beach at San Diego and I will tell him what the person
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>in whom I have hope says. If he accepts, we will
get justice, and if he does not accept, I will be the first to fall in
the fight which we will begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias will not die. Elias will be
chief, when Captain Pablo falls, satisfied in his revenge,&rdquo; said
the old man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=

<h2 class="main">The Cock Fight.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In order to keep the Sabbath holy in the Philippines
the people generally go to the cock fight, just as in Spain they go to
the bull fight. Cock fighting, a passion introduced into the country
and exploited for a century, is one of the vices of the people, more
deeply rooted than the opium vice among the Chinese. The poor go there
to risk what little they have, desirous of making money without
working; the rich go there to amuse themselves, using the money which
they have left over from their feasts and thanksgiving masses. The cock
is educated with great care, with more care, perhaps, than the son who
is to succeed his father in the cock-pit. The Government permits it and
almost recommends it, for it decrees that the fight shall only be held
in the public plazas and on holidays from after high mass till
dark&mdash;eight hours.</p>
<p>The San Diego cock-pit does not differ from others which are found
in all the towns. It consists of three parts: The first, or entrance,
is a large rectangle, some twenty meters in length and fourteen in
breadth. On one side is the door, generally guarded by a woman who
collects the entrance fee. From the contribution which each one makes
the Government receives a part, some hundred thousands of <i>pesos</i>
each year. They say that with this money, which gives license to the
vice, magnificent schools are raised, bridges and roadways constructed,
and rewards offered for the encouragement of agriculture and commerce.
Blessed be the vice which produces such good results! In this first
precinct are the <span class="corr" id="xd21e4630" title=
"Source: venders">vendors</span> of betel nut, cigars and tobacco,
delicacies and refreshments. There the small boys, who accompany their
fathers or uncles, are carefully initiated into the secrets of
life.</p>
<p>This precinct communicates with another of slightly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>larger dimensions, a sort of vestibule, where
the people gather before the fight. There, one sees most of the cocks,
tied by a cord to a bone driven into the ground like a nail; there, are
the bettors, the lovers of the sport, the man skilled in fastening the
gaffs or spurs to the cock&rsquo;s legs; there, bargains are made, the
situation discussed, money borrowed, and people curse, swear and laugh
boisterously. In one place, some one is caressing his game cock,
passing his hand over his brilliant plumage; in another, a man examines
and counts the number of scales on the rooster&rsquo;s legs, for that,
they say, is a sign of valor. The battles of the heroes are related.
There, too, you will see many a disappointed owner, with a sour face
carrying out by the legs, a dead rooster, stripped of its
plumage&mdash;the animal which was a favorite for months, petted, cared
for day and night, and on which flattering hopes had been founded: now,
nothing more than a dead fowl, to be sold for a <i>peseta</i>, stewed
in ginger and eaten that very night. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi!</i>
The loser returns to his fire-side, where an anxious wife and ragged
children await him, without his little capital, without his rooster.
From all that gilded dream, from all the care of months, from daybreak
to sunset, from all those labors and fatigue, from all that, results a
<i>peseta</i>, the ashes left from so much smoke.</p>
<p>In this <i>foyer</i>, or vestibule, the most ignorant discuss the
coming contests; the most trifling, examine conscientiously the bird,
weigh it, contemplate it, extend its wings, feel of its muscles. Some
of the people are very well dressed, and are followed and surrounded by
the backers of their game cocks. Others, dirty, with the seal of vice
imprinted on their squalid faces, anxiously follow the movements of the
rich and watch their betting, for the pocketbook can be emptied and the
passion still be unsatisfied. There you see no face that is not
animated, no indolent Filipino; none apathetic, none silent. All is
movement, passion, eagerness.</p>
<p>From this place, one passes into the arena or <i>rueda</i>, as it is
called. The floor, inclosed by bamboos, is generally elevated higher
than the floor of the other two parts of the cock-pit. Running up from
the floor and almost touching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174"
href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>the roof, are rows of seats
for the spectators or gamblers&mdash;they come to be the same. During
the combat these seats are filled with men and children who cry, shout,
perspire, quarrel, and blaspheme. Fortunately, scarcely any women visit
the cock-pit. In the <i>rueda</i> are the prominent men, the rich
class, the bettors, the bookmaker, and the referee. The cocks fight on
the ground, which is beaten down perfectly smooth, and there Destiny
distributes to families laughter or tears, feasts or hunger.</p>
<p>As we enter, we can see the <i>gobernadorcillo</i>, Captain Pablo,
Captain Basilio, and Lucas, the man with the scar on his face who was
so disconsolate over the death of his brother.</p>
<p>Captain Basilio approaches one of those present and asks him:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know what cock Captain
Tiago is going to bring?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not know, Se&ntilde;or. This
morning two arrived, one of them the <i>l&aacute;sak</i> (black
sprinkled with white) which whipped the Consul&rsquo;s <i>talisain</i>
(red, sprinkled with black).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you think that my <i>bulik</i>
(black, red and white), can beat him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, I surely do. I&rsquo;ll stake
my house and shirt on him!<span class="corr" id="xd21e4686" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>At that moment Captain Tiago arrived. He was dressed, like the big
gamblers, in a <i>camisa</i> of Canton linen, woolen pantaloons, and a
panama-straw hat. Behind him came two servants, carrying the
<i>l&aacute;sak</i> and a white cock of colossal proportions.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sinang tells me that Maria Clara
is improving steadily,&rdquo; said Captain Basilio.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She no longer has any fever, but
she is still weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you lose last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A little. I heard that you won....
I am going to see if I can win back my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you want to fight your
<i>l&aacute;sak</i>?&rdquo; asked Captain Basilio, looking at the
rooster.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That depends on whether there is
any money up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How much will you
stake?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play less than two
thousand.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175"
name="pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you seen my
<i>bulik</i>?&rdquo; asked Captain Basilio, and then called a man to
bring a small rooster.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago examined it, and after weighing it in his hand, and
examining its scales, he handed it back.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you put up?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Two thousand five
hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Make it three?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The circle of curious people and gamblers learn that the two
celebrated cocks are to be fought. Both the roosters have made a
history for themselves; both have a reputation. All want to see and
examine the two celebrities. Opinions are expressed, and prophecies
made.</p>
<p>In the meantime the voices grow louder, the confusion is augmented,
the <i>rueda</i> fills up and a rush is made for the seats. The
<i>soltadores</i> bring two cocks to the ring for a preliminary
contest. One of the roosters is <i>blanco</i> (white), the other
<i>rojo</i> (red). They are already spurred, but the gaffs are not yet
unsheathed. Cries of &ldquo;<i>Al blanco! al blanco!</i>&rdquo; are
heard. Some one else shouts, &ldquo;<i>Al rojo!</i>&rdquo; The
<i>blanco</i> is the favorite.</p>
<p>Civil Guards circulate among the crowd. They are not wearing the
uniform of their body, nor do they wear the costume of the native.
Pantaloons of <i>guingon</i> with a red fringe, a blue-spotted blouse
shirt, and the <i>cuartel</i> cap&mdash;you have here their disguise,
in harmony with their deportment; watching and betting, making
disturbance and talking of maintaining the peace.</p>
<p>While the shouting is going on and men are jingling money in their
hands; while the people are going down in their pockets for the last
<i>cuarto</i>, or, if that is wanting, pledging their word, promising
to sell their <i>carabao</i>, or their next harvest, two young men,
apparently brothers, follow the gamblers with envious eyes. They
approach, timidly murmur words which nobody catches, and each time
become more and more melancholy, and look at each other with disgust
and indignation. Lucas observes them, smiles malignantly, rattles some
silver <i>pesos</i>, passes near to the two brothers, and looks toward
the <i>rueda</i>, shouting: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href=
"#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am betting fifty, fifty against
twenty on the white!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two brothers <span class="corr" id="xd21e4791" title=
"Source: exchange">exchanged</span> looks.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; murmured the
older, &ldquo;not to bet all your money. If you had obeyed me, we would
have it now to put on the red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger one approached Lucas timidly and touched him on the
arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; exclaimed the
latter turning around and feigning surprise. &ldquo;Does your brother
accept my proposition or did you come to bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How can we bet when we have lost
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then you accept?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He does not want to! If you could
lend us something: you have already said that you knew
us....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucas scratched his head, pulled down his <i>camisa</i> and
replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, I know you. You are Tarsilo
and Bruno, both young and strong. I know that your brave father died
from the result of the hundred lashes which the soldiers gave him. I
know that you do not think of avenging him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You need not meddle in our
history,&rdquo; interrupted Tarsilo, the older. &ldquo;That is a
disgrace. If we did not have a sister, we would have been hanged long
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hanged? They only hang cowards, or
some one who has no money or protection. Certainly the mountains are
near.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A hundred against twenty on the
<i>blanco</i>,&rdquo; cried one as he passed the group.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Loan us four <i>pesos</i> ...
three ... two,&rdquo; begged the younger brother. &ldquo;Presently I
will return it to you doubled. The fight is going to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucas scratched his head again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tst! This money is not mine. Don
Crisostomo has given it to me for those who want to serve him. But I
see that you are not like your father. He was really
courageous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, saying this, he went away from them, although not far.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us accept. What does it
matter?&rdquo; said Bruno to his brother. &ldquo;It amounts to the same
thing whether you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span>are hanged or shot down. We poor serve for
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right, but think of our
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the circle around the ring had been dispersed; the
fight was going to commence. The voices began to die away, and the two
<i>soltadores</i> and the skilled gaff fitter, were alone in the middle
of the <i>rueda</i>. At a signal from the referee, the sheaths were
removed from the razor-like knives on the cocks&rsquo; legs, and the
fine blades glistened in a menacing way.</p>
<p>The two brothers, gloomy and silent, approached the ring and,
resting their faces against the bamboo railing, watched the
preparations. A man approached them and said in their ears:
&ldquo;Hundred to ten on the <i>blanco</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarsilo looked at him stupidly. Bruno elbowed his brother, who
responded with a grunt.</p>
<p>The <i>soltadores</i> handle the roosters with masterly skill,
taking great care not to wound them. A deep silence reigns throughout
the pit. You would think that those present, with the exception of the
two <i>soltadores</i>, were horrible wax figures. The two roosters are
brought close together and allowed to pick at each other and thus
become irritated. Then they allow them to look at each other, so that
the poor little birds may know who has plucked out their feathers, and
with whom they should fight. The feathers around the neck stand up;
they look at each other fixedly; flashes of wrath escape from their
little, round eyes. The moment has come. The birds are placed on the
ground in the ring at a certain distance from each other.</p>
<p>The cocks advance slowly. Their little steps are heard upon the hard
floor. Nobody speaks; nobody breathes. Lowering and raising their
heads, as if measuring each other with a look, the two roosters mutter
sounds, perhaps of threat or contempt. They have perceived the shining
blades. Danger animates them, and they turn toward each other decided,
but they stop at a short distance, and, as they look at each other,
they bow their heads and again raise their feathers on end. With their
natural valor, they rush at each other impetuously; they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>strike beak against beak; breast against breast,
blade against blade, and wing against wing. The blows have been stopped
with dexterity and skill, and only a few feathers have fallen. They
again measure each other! Suddenly the <i>blanco</i> turns and, raising
himself in the air, flashes his death-dealing knife, but the
<i>rojo</i> has already doubled up his legs, ducked his head and the
<i>blanco</i> has only cut the air. Then, on touching the ground, to
avoid being wounded from behind, he turns quickly and faces the other.
The red attacks him with fury, but he defends himself with coolness.
Not without reason was he the favorite of the crowd. All, trembling and
anxious, follow the movements of the battle, now this one and now that
one giving an involuntary shout. The ground is being covered with red
and white feathers, tinged with blood. But the duel does not go to the
one who draws first blood. The Filipino here follows the laws laid down
by the Government, which say that the cock which is killed or flees
loses the fight. The blood now wets the ground; the blows are repeated,
but the victory is still undecided. Finally, making a supreme effort,
the <i>blanco</i> throws himself forward to give a last blow; he drives
his knife into the wing of the <i>rojo</i> and buries it among the
bones. But the <i>blanco</i> has been wounded in the breast, and both,
weak from loss of blood, and panting, fastened together, remain
immovable until the <i>blanco</i> falls, bleeds through his neck, kicks
violently and is in the agony of death. The <i>rojo</i>, pinned by his
wing, is held to the other&rsquo;s side; and little by little he
doubles up his legs and slowly closes his eyes.</p>
<p>Then the referee, in accordance with the regulations prescribed by
the Government, declares the <i>rojo</i> the winner. A wild and
prolonged outcry greets the decision, an outcry which is heard
throughout the town. He, who, from afar, hears the cry, understands
that the <i>dejado</i> has beaten the favorite, for otherwise the
outcry would not have lasted so long. So it happens among nations: when
a small nation succeeds in gaining a victory over a greater one, the
song and story of it last through centuries.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you see?&rdquo; said Bruno,
with indignation, to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>brother, &ldquo;if you had taken
my advice to-day, we would have had one hundred <i>pesos</i>. On your
account we are without a <i>cuarto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarsilo did not reply, but, with wide-open eyes, looked around him
as if in search of some one.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There he is talking with
Pedro,&rdquo; added Bruno. &ldquo;He is giving him money&mdash;what a
lot of money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarsilo remained silent and thoughtful. With the arm of his
<i>camisa</i>, he wiped away the sweat which formed in drops on his
forehead.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Bruno,
&ldquo;I am decided, even if you are not. The <i>l&aacute;sak</i> ought
to win and we ought not to lose the opportunity. I want to bet on the
next fight. What does it matter? Thus, we will avenge our
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Tarsilo to him,
and looked him in the eyes. Both were pale. &ldquo;I am with you. You
are right. We will avenge our father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, however, and again wiped away the perspiration.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why do you stop?&rdquo; asked
Bruno impatiently.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know what fight is the next
one? Is it worth the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! Haven&rsquo;t you heard?
Captain Tiago&rsquo;s <i>l&aacute;sak</i> against Captain
Basilio&rsquo;s <i>bulik</i>. According to the run of luck, the
<i>l&aacute;sak</i> ought to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! The <i>l&aacute;sak</i>. I
would bet ... but let us make sure first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno made a gesture of impatience, but followed his brother. The
latter looked the rooster over carefully, thought about it, debated
with himself and asked a few questions. The unfortunate fellow was in
doubt. Bruno was nervous and looked at him angrily.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see that wide
scale which he has there near the spur? Do you see those feet? What
more do you want? Look at those legs. Stretch out his wings. And that
broken scale on top of that wide one, and that double one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarsilo did not hear him, he kept on examining the cock. The rattle
of silver coins reached his ears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us see the <i>bulik</i>
now,&rdquo; said he, in a choking voice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bruno stamped the ground with his feet, grated his teeth, but obeyed
his brother.</p>
<p>They approached the other group. There they were arming the cock,
they were selecting gaffs for him, and the expert, in fitting them to
the rooster&rsquo;s legs, was preparing a piece of red silk. He waxed
it and rubbed it over his knee a number of times.</p>
<p>Tarsilo gazed at the bird with a sombre air. It seemed that he was
not looking at the cock, but at something in the future. He passed his
hand over his forehead.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked his
brother, his voice scarcely perceptible.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I? Long ago. Without having to see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is our poor
sister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! Didn&rsquo;t they tell you
that the leader is Don Crisostomo? Have you not seen him walking with
the Governor General? What danger will we run?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if we are killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does it matter? Our father
died from being whipped to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both brothers sought Lucas in the crowd.</p>
<p>As soon as they caught sight of him, Tarsilo stopped.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No! Let us go away from here! We
are going to lose,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go if you wish. I am going to
accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a man approached them and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you betting? I am backing the
<i>bulik</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two brothers did not reply.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Bruno.</p>
<p>The man counted out four <i>peso</i> pieces. Bruno looked at him,
breathless.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have two hundred. Fifty to
forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bruno promptly.
&ldquo;Make it ...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All right! fifty to
thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Double it if you wish!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well! The <i>bulik</i> is my
winning color and I have just won. Hundred against sixty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a go! Wait till I go
and get my money.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But I will be the
stake-holder,&rdquo; said the other, in whom the manner of Bruno
inspired little confidence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to
me!&rdquo; responded the latter, trusting in the strength of his
fists.</p>
<p><a id="xd21e5034" name="xd21e5034"></a>And, turning to his brother,
he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go away, if you wish; I&rsquo;m
going to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Tarsilo reflected. He loved his brother and the game. He could
not leave him alone, and he murmured. &ldquo;Let it be so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They approached Lucas. The latter saw them coming and smiled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Eh! there!&rdquo; said
Tarsilo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How much do you give?&rdquo; asked
the two brothers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have already told you. If you
want to find some others to help us surprise the <i>cuartel</i>, I will
give you thirty <i>pesos</i> apiece, and ten <i>pesos</i> for each
companion you get. If all comes out well, each will receive one hundred
<i>pesos</i> and you two, double that amount. Don Crisostomo is
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Accepted,&rdquo; exclaimed Bruno.
&ldquo;Hand over the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I knew well that you were brave,
like your father. Come! Don&rsquo;t let them hear us or they will kill
us,&rdquo; said Lucas, pointing to the Civil Guards.</p>
<p>And taking them into a corner, he told them, as he counted out the
money to them:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To-morrow Don Crisostomo will
arrive and bring arms. Day after to-morrow, about eight o&rsquo;clock
at night, come to the cemetery. I will tell you about the final
arrangements. You have time to find some other companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took leave of each other. Now the two brothers seemed to have
changed their r&ocirc;les. Tarsilo was calm; Bruno, pale. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Two Se&ntilde;oras.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While Captain Tiago was fighting his
<i>l&aacute;sak</i> against the <i>bulik</i>, Do&ntilde;a Victorina
took a walk through the town, with the intention of seeing the
condition of the indolent natives, and of their houses and fields. She
had dressed as elegantly as she could, putting all her ribbons and
flowers on her silk gown, in order to impress the provincials, and make
them see how great a distance was between them and her sacred person.
Giving her arm to her lame husband, she fluttered through the streets
of the town, among the stupefied and wondering inhabitants. Cousin
Linares had remained in the house.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What ugly houses these natives
have,&rdquo; began Do&ntilde;a Victorina, making a grimace. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know how they can live there: one must be a native to do
it. They meet us and don&rsquo;t uncover their heads! Hit them over the
head as the curates and <i>tenientes</i> of the <i>Guardia Civil</i> do
when they don&rsquo;t take off their hats. Teach them
manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if they hit me?&rdquo; asked
Dr. de Espada&ntilde;a.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bu&mdash;bu&mdash;but, I am
la&mdash;la&mdash;lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina was becoming bad-humored. The streets were not
paved, and the train of her gown was covered with dust. Besides, they
met many young women, who, on passing her, cast down their eyes and did
not admire her lavish dress as they should have done. Sinang&rsquo;s
coachman, who was driving her and her cousin in an elegant carriage,
had the impudence to call out <i>tabi</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5105src" href="#xd21e5105" name="xd21e5105src">1</a> to them in
such a warning voice that she had to get out of the way, and was only
able to exclaim, &ldquo;Look at that brute of a coachman! I am going to
tell his master that he should educate his servants better!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us go back to the
house,&rdquo; she ordered her husband.</p>
<p>He, fearing that there was going to be a storm, turned on his heels
and obeyed the command.</p>
<p>They met the <i>alferez</i> on the way back and greeted him. He
increased the discontent of Do&ntilde;a Victorina, for he not only
failed to compliment her on her dress, but surveyed it almost with a
mocking manner.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You ought not to extend your hand
to a simple <i>alferez</i>,&rdquo; said she to her husband as soon as
they were some distance away. &ldquo;He scarcely touches his helmet,
and you take off your hat. You don&rsquo;t know how to maintain your
rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is ch&mdash;ch&mdash;chief
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what does that matter to us?
Are we, perchance, natives?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; replied he,
not wishing to quarrel.</p>
<p>They passed by the officer&rsquo;s house. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion
was in the window, as usual, dressed in her flannel outfit and smoking
her cigar. As the house was rather low, they could see each other as
they passed, and Do&ntilde;a Victorina could distinguish her very well.
The Muse of the <i>Guardia Civil</i> examined her with tranquillity
from head to foot, and, afterward, sticking out her lower lip, spit,
turning her face to the other side. That put an end to Do&ntilde;a
Victorina&rsquo;s patience, and, leaving her husband without any
support, she squared herself in front of the <i>alfereza</i>, trembling
with rage, and unable to speak. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion turned her head
slowly, looked her over again, and then spit again, but with still
greater disdain.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the matter with you,
Do&ntilde;a?&rdquo; said the <i>alfereza</i>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Can you tell me, Se&ntilde;ora,
why you look at me so? Are you envious?&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Victorina
finally succeeded in saying.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I envious of you?&rdquo; said the
Medusa with scorn. &ldquo;O, yes! I envy those curls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, wife!&rdquo; said the
doctor. &ldquo;Do&mdash;don&rsquo;t take no&mdash;no&mdash;notice of
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me give this shameless common
person a lesson!&rdquo; replied the woman, giving her husband a push.
He nearly fell to the ground. Turning to Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, she
continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look how you treat me! Don&rsquo;t
think that I am a provincial, or a soldiers&rsquo; <i>querida</i>! In
my house in Manila <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184"
name="pb184">184</a>]</span><i>alferezas</i> never are allowed to come
in. They wait at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh-oh! Most Excellent
Se&ntilde;ora! <i>Alferezas</i> don&rsquo;t enter, but invalids like
that out there. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it hadn&rsquo;t been for all the paint on her face, one could
have seen Do&ntilde;a Victorina blush. She wanted to throw herself upon
her enemy, but the sentry stopped her. In the meantime, the street was
filling up with curious people.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen! I lower myself talking
with you. People of <i>categor&iacute;a</i> ... Do you want my clothes
to wash? I will pay you well. Do you think that I don&rsquo;t know that
you are a washerwoman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion became furious. The reference to her being a
washerwoman wounded her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you think that we do not know
what you are? Get out! My husband has already told me. Se&ntilde;ora,
I, at least, have not belonged to more than one man, but you? One must
be pretty hard up to take the leavings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This shot struck Do&ntilde;a Victorina square in the breast. She
rolled up her sleeves, clenched her fists, and, gnashing her teeth,
began:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come down here, you nasty old
thing, that I may smash your filthy mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Medusa disappeared quickly from the window, but was soon seen
coming down the stairs on a run, swinging her husband&rsquo;s whip.</p>
<p>Don Tiburcio interposed, pleading with them, but they would have
come to blows if the <i>alferez</i> had not arrived.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;oras!... Don
Tiburcio!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Teach your woman better; buy her
better clothes. If you haven&rsquo;t the money, rob the people. You
have your soldiers for that!&rdquo; shouted Do&ntilde;a Victorina.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; said the
<i>alferez</i> furiously. &ldquo;Thank yourself that I don&rsquo;t
forget that you are a woman; for if you were not, I would kick you to
pieces, with all your curls and ribbons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&mdash;se&mdash;se&ntilde;or
<i>al&mdash;alferez</i>!&rdquo; said Don Tiburcio.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go ahead! Kill us! You don&rsquo;t
wear big enough trousers, you quack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the battle waged: words, gestures, cries, insults, and
injuries. They brought out all the nasty things they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>could think of, all four speaking at the same
time, and, saying so many things and bringing to light so many truths,
that we will not relate here all that was said. The people who had
gathered around to satisfy their curiosity, if they understood all the
remarks, must have enjoyed themselves not a little. They were all
waiting to see them come to blows. Unfortunately for the spectators,
the curate came along and pacified them.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;oras! se&ntilde;oras!
What a shame. Se&ntilde;or <i>alferez</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you meddling in these
matters for, you hypocrite, you Carlist?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Tiburcio, take away your wife!
Se&ntilde;ora, hold your tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell that to those robbers of the
poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the dictionary of epithets was exhausted. The review of the
disgraces of each couple was ended, and little by little they were
separated, threatening and insulting each other. Father Salv&iacute;
kept going from one side to the other, adding life to the scene.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This very day we will go to Manila
and we will present ourselves to the Governor General,&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, in fury to her husband. &ldquo;You are not a
man. It is a shame that you spend money for trousers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;B&mdash;b&mdash;but, wife, and the
<i lang="es">Guardia Civil</i>? I&mdash;I&mdash;am lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You must challenge him to a duel
with pistol or sword or, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Do&ntilde;a Victorina looked at his false teeth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Daughter, I never have
used&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina did not let him finish. With a sublime
movement she jerked out his false teeth in the middle of the street,
and throwing them to the ground stepped on them. He, half crying, and
she sputtering away, arrived at the house. At that time, Linares was
talking with Maria Clara, Sinang, and Victoria, and, as he knew nothing
about the quarrel, the sudden arrival of his cousins gave him a shock.
Maria Clara was lying on a sofa among pillows and blankets, and was not
a little surprised at the doctor&rsquo;s new <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5238" title="Source: physiogomy">physiognomy</span>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, &ldquo;you have got to challenge the <i>alferez</i>
immediately to a duel, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And why? what for?&rdquo; asked
Linares, surprised.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You challenge him right off, or I
will tell them all who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, Do&ntilde;a
Victorina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three young women looked at one another.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The <i>alferez</i> has insulted
us. The old witch came down with her whip, and that thing there allowed
it all. A man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Sinang.
&ldquo;They have been fighting and we haven&rsquo;t seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The <i>alferez</i> has broken the
doctor&rsquo;s teeth,&rdquo; added Victoria.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This very day we are going to
Manila. You stay here to challenge him to a duel, and, if you
don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll tell Don Santiago that all that you have told
him is a lie. I will tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, Do&ntilde;a Victorina!
Do&ntilde;a Victorina!&rdquo; interrupted Linares, pale and going
closer to her. &ldquo;You keep quiet. Don&rsquo;t make me call to
mind&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;and he added in a low
voice&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be imprudent, especially just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that time, when this was going on, Captain Tiago arrived
home from the cock-pit. He was downhearted. He had lost his
<i>l&aacute;sak</i>.</p>
<p>But Do&ntilde;a Victorina did not give him much time to sigh. In a
few words, and with many insults, she related to him what had passed,
she, of course, trying to put herself in a good light.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Linares is going to challenge him.
Do you hear? If he don&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t let him marry your
daughter. Don&rsquo;t you permit it. If he has no courage, he does not
merit Clarita.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then you are going to marry this
gentleman?&rdquo; asked Sinang, with her jolly eyes full of tears.
&ldquo;I knew that you were discreet, but I did not think you so
fickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara, pale as wax, raising herself half up, looked at her
father with frightened eyes, and then at Do&ntilde;a Victorina and
Linares. The latter turned red in the face, Captain Tiago looked down,
and the se&ntilde;ora added:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Clarita, bear it in mind, and
never marry a man who does not wear trousers. You expose yourself to
insults like a dog, if you do.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the young maiden did not reply and said to her friends:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take me to my room, for I cannot
go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They helped her to her feet, and, leaning her marble-like head on
pretty Sinang&rsquo;s shoulder, and, with the arms of her friend around
her waist, she went to her bedroom.</p>
<p>That night the doctor and his wife collected their things together,
submitted their account to Captain Tiago&mdash;which amounted to
several thousand <i>pesos</i>&mdash;and very early on the following
day, left for Manila in the Captain&rsquo;s carriage. To timid Linares
they intrusted the r&ocirc;le of the avenger. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As Lucas had announced, Ibarra arrived the next day.
His first visit was to the family of Captain Tiago, with the object of
seeing Maria Clara and telling her that His Most Illustrious Greatness
had already reconciled him with the Church. He brought a letter of
recommendation to the curate, written by the hand of the Archbishop
himself. Aunt Isabel was not a little delighted over it, for she liked
the young man and did not look favorably upon the marriage of her niece
with Linares. Captain Tiago was not at home.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the aunt in
her half-Castellano language. &ldquo;Maria, Don Crisostomo is again in
the grace of God. The Archbishop has dis-excommunicated him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young man could not advance. His smile froze on his lips,
and words fled from his mind. Linares was standing next to Maria Clara
on the balcony, interweaving nosegays with the flowers and leaves on
the climbing plants. On the floor, were scattered roses and
<i>sampagas</i>. Maria Clara was leaning back on a sofa, pale, pensive,
her look sad, playing with her ivory fan. But the fan was not as white
as her poor fingers.</p>
<p>At the presence of Ibarra, Linares turned pale and Maria
Clara&rsquo;s cheeks were tinged with carmine. She tried to rise, but
her strength failing her, she cast her eyes upon the floor, and let
fall her fan.</p>
<p>An embarrassing silence reigned for several seconds. Finally, Ibarra
was able to advance, and tremblingly murmured:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have just arrived and have
hastened to see you.... I find that you are better than I
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara seemed to have turned dumb. She could <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>not
pronounce a single word, and continued to keep her eyes on the
floor.</p>
<p>Ibarra surveyed Linares with a look which the modest young man bore
with considerable haughtiness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, I see that my arrival was
not expected,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Maria, pardon me for not
having announced my coming. Some other day I will be able to explain to
you my conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were accompanied with a look at Linares. The maiden
raised her eyes to Ibarra, those beautiful eyes, full of purity and
melancholy, so supplicating and sweet that Ibarra stopped confused.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May I come to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know that on my part you are
always welcome,&rdquo; replied she, scarcely able to pronounce the
words.</p>
<p>Ibarra walked away, apparently tranquil; but a tempest raged in his
mind, and his heart was chilled. What he had just seen and felt was
incomprehensible. What was it? Doubt, apathy or treason?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, woman!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>He arrived, without noticing it, at the place where the school house
was being constructed. The work was well along. &Ntilde;or Juan, with
his yard stick and plumb-line, was going to and fro among the numerous
workmen. On seeing the young man approach, he ran to meet him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Crisostomo,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you have arrived at last. We were all expecting you. Just see
how the walls are rising. They are already a meter and ten centimeters
high. Within two days, they will be as high as a man. I have not
allowed them to use anything but the best of wood. Do you want to look
at the cellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workmen saluted him respectfully.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Here is the system of drainage
which I have taken the liberty to add,&rdquo; said &Ntilde;or Juan.
&ldquo;These underground canals lead to a cesspool about thirty feet
off. It will serve to fertilize the garden. This was not in the plans.
Do you object to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Quite on the contrary, I approve
of it and I congratulate you on your idea. You are a true architect.
From whom did you learn the profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;From myself, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
replied the modest old man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;O, yes! Before I forget it: let
the scrupulous people know (for some may fear to speak to me) that I am
no longer excommunicated. The Archbishop invited me to dine with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pshaw! se&ntilde;or! We
don&rsquo;t take any notice of excommunications. We are all
excommunicated. Dather D&aacute;maso is himself; however, he goes on,
as fat as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I feel sure about it. A year ago
he gave the coadjutor a blow with his cane, and the coadjutor is as
much a priest as he. Who takes any notice of excommunications,
se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra caught sight of Elias among the workmen. He saluted him like
the others, but with a look that gave Ibarra to understand that he
wanted to speak with him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;&Ntilde;or Juan,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, &ldquo;will you bring me a list of the workmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&Ntilde;or Juan disappeared and Ibarra approached Elias, who was
alone, raising a large stone and loading it in a cart.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you are able, se&ntilde;or, to
grant me some hours of conversation, come this afternoon to the shore
of the lake and embark in my <i>banca</i>, for I want to talk with you
about some serious matters,&rdquo; said Elias. Ibarra gave a nod of
assent and went away.</p>
<p>&Ntilde;or Juan brought the list, but Ibarra read it in vain. The
name of Elias was not on it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=

<h2 class="main">The Voice of the Persecuted.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before the sun went down, Ibarra put his foot into
Elias&rsquo;s <i>banca</i> on the shore of the lake. He seemed
displeased about something, as though he had been opposed or
contradicted.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pardon me, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
said Elias on seeing him. &ldquo;Pardon me for having ventured to make
this appointment with you. I would like to speak with you freely, and
here we have no witnesses. We can return within an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are mistaken, friend
Elias,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, trying to smile. &ldquo;You will have to
take me to that town over there, where you see that belfry. Fate
obliges me to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes; on my way here, I met the
<i>alferez</i>. He insisted upon accompanying me. I thought about you,
and knew that he would recognize you, and, in order to get rid of him,
I told him that I was going to that town. Now I will have to remain
there all day to-morrow, for the man whom I am going to see will not
look for me till to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am obliged to you for your
thoughtfulness, but you might have simply told him to accompany
you,&rdquo; replied Elias with naturalness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? And what about
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He would never have recognized me.
The only time that he ever saw me, I don&rsquo;t believe that he
thought to take down a description of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am in hard luck!&rdquo; sighed
Ibarra, thinking of Maria Clara. &ldquo;What have you to say to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias looked around him. They were far from the shore. The sun had
already sunk below the horizon, and, as the twilight in these latitudes
is very short, the darkness was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192"
href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>falling over the earth, and
the disk of the full moon was already shining.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Elias, in a grave voice, &ldquo;I am the spokesman of many unfortunate
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Unfortunate people. What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few words, Elias referred to the conversation which he had had
with the chief of the <i>tulisanes</i>, but omitted saying anything
about the doubts which the chief entertained, or the threats. Ibarra
listened attentively, and, when Elias concluded his story, a long
silence reigned. Ibarra was the first to break the spell.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So that they
desire&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Radical reforms in the armed
forces, in the religious matters, and in the administration of justice.
That is to say, they ask for paternal care on the part of the
Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Reforms? In what sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For example: more respect for
human dignity; more security for the individual; less power in the
hands of the forces already armed; fewer privileges for that body which
easily abuses them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; replied the young
man, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but I believe that you are
not an ordinary man. You think and work differently from the others.
You will understand me if I say to you that, even if it is true that
the present state of affairs is defective, there will be a worse state
if there is a change. I could arrange to get the assistance of my
friends in Madrid, by <i>paying them</i>. I could speak to the Governor
General, but all of that would accomplish nothing. He has not enough
power to introduce reforms, nor would I ever take a step in that
direction, for I know very well that, if it is true that these
religious corporations have their defects, they are now necessities.
They are what you might call a necessary evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias raised his head and looked astonished.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you believe, se&ntilde;or, in
necessary evils?&rdquo; he asked, his voice slightly trembling.
&ldquo;Do you believe that in order to do good it is necessary to do
evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No. I look upon it as a violent
remedy which we have to make use of to cure an illness. To illustrate
further, the country is an organism which is suffering from a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>chronic illness, and, in order to cure it, the
Government finds itself compelled to use medicines, hard and violent,
if you wish, but useful and necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is a bad doctor, se&ntilde;or,
who seeks to cure the symptoms and suppress them without trying to find
the origin of the illness, or knowing it, fears to attack it. The
<i>Guardia Civil</i> has no other end than this: the suppression of
crime by terror and force. This end it neither fulfills nor carries out
except in chance instances. And you have to take into account that
society can be severe with individuals only after she has furnished all
means necessary for their perfect morality. In our country, since there
is no society, since the people and the Government do not form a unity,
the latter ought to be indulgent, not only because indulgence is
necessary, but because the individual, neglected and abandoned by
Government, has less self responsibility than if he had been
enlightened. Besides, following out your comparison, the medicine
applied to the evils of the country is so much of a destroyer that its
effect is only felt on the sane parts of the organism. These it weakens
and injures. Would it not be more reasonable to fortify and strengthen
the infirm organism and minimize a little the violence of the
medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To weaken the <i>Guardia Civil</i>
would be to put the security of the towns in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The security of the towns!&rdquo;
exclaimed Elias with bitterness. &ldquo;The towns have had the
<i>Guardia Civil</i> for nearly fifteen years and what is the result?
We still have <i>tulisanes</i>, we still hear of them sacking towns,
and they still make their attacks on people on the roads. Robberies
continue and the robbers are not punished. Crime exists and the real
criminal goes free, but not so with the peaceful inhabitants of the
town. Ask any honorable citizen if he looks upon this institution as a
good, as a protection by the Government, or as an imposition, a
despotism whose excesses do more harm than the violence of the
criminals. Communication between people is paralyzed, for they fear to
be maltreated for trifling causes. More importance is attached to the
formality of the law than to the basal principle of it,&mdash;the first
symptom of incapacity in government. The heads of the organization
consider it their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194"
name="pb194">194</a>]</span>first duty to make people salute them,
either of their own will or by force, even in the darkness of night. In
this, their inferior officers imitate them and maltreat and fleece the
poor countrymen. There is no such thing as sacredness of the fireside.
There is no security for the individual. What have the people
accomplished by overcoming their wrath and by waiting for justice at
the hands of others? Ah! se&ntilde;or, if you call that preserving the
order&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I agree with you that there are
evils,&rdquo; replied Ibarra. &ldquo;But we have to accept those evils
for the good which accompanies them. This institution may be imperfect,
but believe me, by the terror which it inspires, it prevents the number
of criminals from increasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You might better say that by that
terror it increases the number of criminals,&rdquo; said Elias,
correcting him. &ldquo;Before this body was created, almost all the
evildoers, with the exception of a very few, were criminals because of
their hunger. They pillaged and robbed in order to live. That famine
once passed over and hunger once satisfied, the roads were again free
from criminals. It was sufficient to have the poor but valiant
<i>cuaderilleros</i> chase them, with their imperfect arms&mdash;that
body of men so often calumniated by those who have written upon our
country, those men who have three legal rights, to do their duty, to
fight and to die. And for all that, a jest as recompense. Now there are
<i>tulisanes</i> who will be <i>tulisanes</i> all their lives. A crime
inhumanly punished, resistance against the excesses of the power which
inflicts such punishment, and fear that other atrocities may be
inflicted&mdash;these make them forever members of that society who are
bound by oath to kill and die<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5474src" href=
"#xd21e5474" name="xd21e5474src">1</a>. The terrorism of the <i>Guardia
Civil</i> impressed upon them closes forever the doors to repentance.
And as a <i>tulisan</i> fights and defends himself in the mountains
better than a soldier, whom he scorns, the result is that we are
incapable of abating the evil which we have created. Call to mind what
the prudent Governor General de la Torre did. The amnesty which he
granted to these unhappy people has proved that in these mountains the
hearts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>men still beat, and only await pardon. Terrorism
is useful only when the people are enslaved, when the mountains have no
caverns, when the governing power can station a sentry behind every
tree, and when the slave has in his body nothing but a stomach. But
when the desperado who fights for his life feels the strong arm of that
power, then his heart beats and his being fills with passion. Can
terrorism put out the fire which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It confuses me, Elias, to hear you
talk so. I would believe that you were right if I did not have my own
convictions. But note this point&mdash;and do not be offended, for I do
not include you&mdash;I look upon you as an exception&mdash;consider
who those are who ask for this reform. Almost all are criminals or
people who are in the way of becoming such.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Criminals or future criminals; but
why are they so? Because their peace has been disturbed, their
happiness taken away from them, their dearest affections wounded, and,
after asking protection from Justice, they have been convinced that
they can secure it only by their own hands, by their own efforts. But
you are mistaken, se&ntilde;or, if you believe that only criminals ask
for it. Go from town to town, from house to house. Listen to the secret
sighings of the family and you will be convinced that the evils which
the <i>Guardia Civil</i> causes are equal to if not greater than those
which it corrects. Would you conclude then that all the citizens are
criminals? Then, why defend them from the others? Why not destroy
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There is some flaw in your
reasoning which escapes me now. In Spain, the Mother Country, this body
lends and has lent very useful services.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not doubt it. Perhaps there
it is better organized; the personnel more select. Perhaps, too, Spain
needs such a body, but the Philippines do not. Our customs, our mode of
living, which are always cited when any one wants to deny us a right,
are totally forgotten when some one wants to impose something on us.
And tell me, se&ntilde;or, why have not other nations adopted this
institution, other nations which resemble Spain more than do the
Philippines? Is it due to the efforts of such an institution that other
nations have fewer robberies of the railways, fewer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>riots, fewer assassinations, and less
hand-to-hand fighting in their great capitals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra bowed his head in meditation. Afterward he raised it and
replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That question, my friend, needs
serious study. If my investigations tell me that these complaints are
well founded, I will write to my friends in Madrid, since we have no
deputies to represent us. In the meantime, believe me, the Government
needs a body like the <i>Guardia Civil</i>, which has unlimited power,
in order to make the people respect its authority and the laws
imposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That would be all right,
se&ntilde;or, if the Government were at war with the country; but, for
the good of the Government, we ought not to make the people believe
that they are in opposition to the law. Furthermore, if that were the
case, if we preferred force to prestige, we ought to look well to whom
we give this unlimited force or power, this authority. Such great power
in the hands of men, and ignorant men at that, men full of passion,
without moral education, without tested honor&mdash;such a thing is a
weapon in the hands of a maniac in a multitude of unarmed people. I
grant and I will agree with you that the Government needs this weapon,
but let it choose that weapon well; let it choose the most worthy men
to bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias was speaking with enthusiasm and with fervor. His eyes
glistened and his voice vibrated. Then followed a solemn pause. The
<i>banca</i>, no longer propelled by the paddle, floated tranquilly on
the waves. The moon was shining majestically from a sapphire sky. Some
lights were glimmering on the shore.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what more do they ask?&rdquo;
said Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Reforms in the priesthood,&rdquo;
responded Elias, in a discouraged and sad tone of voice. &ldquo;The
unfortunates ask more protection against&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Against the religious
orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Against their oppressors,
se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have the Filipinos forgotten what
they owe to these orders? Have they forgotten the immense debt of
gratitude they owe to them for having saved them from error and given
them the Faith? What they owe to them for protection against the civil
power? Here is one of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>evils which result from not
teaching the history of the country in our schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias, surprised, could scarcely give credit to what he heard.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he replied in
a grave voice. &ldquo;You accuse the people of ingratitude: permit me,
one of those who suffer, to defend the people. Favors, in order to be
recognized as such, must be done by persons with disinterested motives.
Let us consider in a general way the mission of the orders, of
Christian charity, that threadbare subject. Let us lay history aside.
Let us not ask what Spain did with the Jews, who gave all Europe a
Book, a religion and a God! Let us not ask what Spain has done with the
Arabic people who gave her culture, who were tolerant in religion and
who reawakened in her a pure national love, fallen into lethargy and
almost <span class="corr" id="xd21e5530" title=
"Source: detroyed">destroyed</span> by the domination of Romans and
Goths. Let us omit all that. Do you say that these orders have given us
the Faith and have saved us from error? Do you call those outward
ceremonies, faith? Do you call that commerce in straps and scapularies
religion? Do you call those miracles and stories which we hear every
day truth? Is that the law of Jesus Christ? To teach such a faith as
this it was not at all necessary that a God should allow himself to be
crucified. Superstition existed long before the friars came here; it
was only necessary to perfect it and to raise the price of the traffic.
Will you tell me that although our religion of to-day is imperfect, it
is better than that which we had before? I will agree with you in that
and grant it; but we have purchased it at too high a price if we have
had to renounce our nationality and independence for it; when for it,
we have given to the priests our best towns, our fields, and still give
them our little savings in order to buy religious objects. A foreign
industry has been introduced among us; we pay well for it, and are in
peace. If you speak of the protection they have afforded us against the
civil governors of the provinces, I would reply that through them we
fall under the power of these governors. However, I recognize that a
true Faith, and a true love for humanity guided the first missionaries
who came to our shores. I recognize the debt of gratitude which is due
those noble hearts. I know that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>in those days Spain abounded
in heroes of all kinds, as well in religion as in politics, as well in
civil life as in military. But because the forefathers were virtuous,
should we consent to the abuses practiced by their degenerate
descendants? Because a great good has been done for us, are we guilty
if we prevent ourselves from being harmed? The country does not ask for
abolition of the priesthood; it only asks for reforms which new
circumstances and new needs require.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I love our country as you love it,
Elias. I understand to some extent what you desire. I have heard with
attention what you have said; yet, despite all of that, my friend, I
believe we are looking upon it with a little prejudice. Here, less than
in other things, I see the necessity of reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Can it be possible,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Elias, discouraged and stretching out his
hands. &ldquo;Do you not see the necessity of reforms, you whose
family&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! I forget myself and I forget
my own injuries for the sake of the security of the Philippines, for
the sake of the interests of Spain,&rdquo; interrupted Ibarra eagerly.
&ldquo;To preserve the Philippines it is necessary that the friars
continue as they are, and in union with Spain lies the welfare of our
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra had ceased speaking, but Elias continued to listen. His face
was sad, his eyes had lost their brilliancy.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The missionaries conquered the
country, it is true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you think that Spain
will be able to keep the Philippines through the instrumentality of the
friars?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, only through the friars. This
is the belief held by all who have written on the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Elias,
discouraged and throwing his paddle <span class="corr" id="xd21e5550"
title="Source: ino">into</span> the bottom of the <i>banca</i>.
&ldquo;I did not think that you had so poor a conception of the
Government and of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra replied: &ldquo;I love our country, not only because it is
the duty of all men to love the country to which they owe their being,
not only because my father taught me so; but also because my mother was
a native, an Indian, and because all my most beautiful memories live in
these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>islands. I love it too, because I owe it my
happiness and will continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And I, I love it because I owe to
it my misfortunes,&rdquo; said Elias.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, my friend, I know that you
are suffering, that you are unfortunate, and that this makes you see a
dark future and influences your way of thinking. For this reason, I
make allowance for your complaints. If I were able to appreciate the
motives, if I had known part of that past&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My misfortunes have another
source. If I had known that they would have been of usefulness, I would
have related them, for aside from that, I make no secret of them. They
are well enough known by many.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Perhaps knowing them would rectify
my opinions. You know I do not rely much upon theories; facts are
better guides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias remained pensive for some moments.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If that is the case,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I will relate briefly the
history of my misfortunes.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200"

<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Some sixty years ago my
grandfather lived in Manila and kept books for a Spanish merchant. My
grandfather was then very young, but was married and had a son. One
night, without any one knowing the cause, the store-house was burned.
The fire spread to the store and from the store to many others. The
losses were very heavy. Search was made for the incendiary, and the
merchant accused my grandfather. In vain he protested and, as he was
poor and could not pay celebrated lawyers, he was condemned to be
whipped publicly and to be led through the streets of Manila. It was
not a great while ago that this infamous punishment was still in use
here. It was a thousand times worse than death itself. My grandfather,
abandoned by everybody except his wife, was tied to a horse and,
followed by a cruel multitude, was whipped on every corner, in the
sight of men, his brothers, and in the vicinity of the numerous temples
of the God of Peace. When the unfortunate man, disgraced forever, had
satisfied the punishment by his blood, his tortures and his cries, they
untied him from the horse, for he had become unconscious. Would to God
he had died! As a refined cruelty, they gave him liberty. His wife,
embarrassed with a child at the time, begged in vain from door to door
for work or alms that she might care for her sick husband and the poor
son. But who would have confidence in the wife of an infamous man
guilty of arson? The wife, then, had to give herself up to
prostitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra started from his seat.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh! do not be disturbed!
Prostitution was not the only dishonor which she and her husband
suffered. Honor and shame no longer existed for them. The husband cured
his wounds, and, with his wife and son, hid in the mountains of this
province. Here the woman brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>forth a still-born child,
deformed and full of disease. In the mountains, they lived for several
months, miserable, isolated, hated and fleeing from all. Unable to
endure the misery, less valorous than his wife, and growing desperate
at seeing her ill and deprived of all aid and comfort, my grandfather
hanged himself. The body rotted in the sight of the son, who was now
scarcely able to take care of his sick mother. The bad odor of the
rotting corpse disclosed it to Justice. My grandmother was accused and
condemned for not having given notice. The death of her husband was
attributed to her and people believed it. For, what is a wife of a
wretch not capable of doing after having prostituted herself? If she
took oath, they said she perjured herself; if she wept, they said that
it was false; and if she invoked God, they said she blasphemed.
However, they had some consideration for her and waited for her to give
birth to a child before whipping her. You know that the friars spread
the belief that the only way to deal with the natives is with the whip.
Read what Father Gaspar de San Augustin says.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thus condemned, the woman cursed
the day when she would give birth to the child, and this not only
prolonged her punishment, but violated her maternal sentiments. The
woman delivered the child, and unfortunately the child was born robust.
Two months later the sentence of whipping which had been imposed upon
her was carried out, to the great satisfaction of the people, who
thought that in this way they were fulfilling their duty. No longer
able to be at peace in these mountains she fled with her two sons to a
neighboring province and there they lived like wild beasts: hating and
hated. The older boy, remembering his happy infancy and its contrast
with such great misery, became a <i>tulisan</i> as soon as he had
sufficient strength. Before long the bloody name of <i>B&aacute;lat</i>
extended from province to province; it was the terror of the towns and
the people, for he took his revenge with fire and blood. The younger
boy, who had received from Nature a good heart, resigned himself to his
lot at his mother&rsquo;s side. They lived on what the forests afforded
them; they dressed in the rags that travellers threw away. The mother
had lost her good name, she was now <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>known only by such
titles as the &lsquo;criminal,&rsquo; the &lsquo;prostitute,&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;horse-whipped woman.&rsquo; The younger brother was known
only as the son of his mother, because he had such a pleasant
disposition that they did not believe him to be the son of the
incendiary. Finally the famous B&aacute;lat fell one day into the hands
of Justice. Society had taught him no good, but he was asked to account
for his crimes. One morning as the younger boy was looking for his
mother, who had gone to gather mushrooms from the forest, and had not
yet returned, he found her lying on the ground by the roadside, under a
cotton-tree. Her face was turned toward the sky, her eyes were torn
from their sockets, and her rigid fingers were buried in the
blood-stained earth. It occurred to the young man to raise his eyes and
follow the direction in which his mother had been looking, and there
from a limb of a tree he saw a basket, and in that basket the bloody
head of his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is what my father must have
exclaimed,&rdquo; continued Elias, coldly. &ldquo;The men had cut the
highwayman into quarters and buried him in a trunk of a tree. But the
limbs were saved, and were hung up in different towns. If you go some
time from Calamba to Santo Tom&aacute;s you will still find the rotting
leg of my uncle hanging from a <i>lomboy</i> tree. Nature has cursed
the tree and it neither grows nor gives fruit. They did the same thing
with the other members of his body, but the head, the head, as the best
part of the man and that part which can be most easily recognized, they
hung before the mother&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra bowed his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The young man fled like one that
is accursed,&rdquo; continued Elias. &ldquo;He fled from town to town,
through mountains and valleys, and when at last he thought he was not
recognized by any one, he began to work in the store of a rich man in
the province of Tayabas. His activity, his agreeable disposition, won
for him the esteem of those who did not know his past life. By working
and saving he managed to make a little capital, and, as the misery had
passed away, and, as he was young, he thought that he would be happy.
His good appearance, his youth, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>his quite
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5610" title=
"Source: unincumbered">unencumbered</span> position won for him the
love of a girl in the town, but he did not dare to ask for her hand,
for fear that she might learn of his past. But love became too strong
and both erred. The man, in order to save the honor of the woman,
risked all; he asked her to marry him, the papers were looked up and
all was disclosed. The girl&rsquo;s father was rich and began to
prosecute the man. The latter, however, did not try to defend himself,
admitted it all and was sent to jail. The young woman gave birth to a
boy and a girl. They were brought up in seclusion and made to believe
that their father was dead. This was not difficult, for while the
children were still young they saw their mother die, and they thought
little about investigating their genealogy. As our grandfather was very
rich, our youth was happy. My sister and I were educated together, we
loved each other as only twins can when they know no other love. While
very young, I went to study in the Jesuit College, and my sister, in
order that we might not be entirely separated, went to the Concordia
boarding school. Our short education having been ended, for we only
wished to be farmers, we returned to the town to take possession of the
inheritance which was left us by our grandfather. We lived happily for
some time; the future smiled on us; we had many servants; our fields
bore good crops; and my sister was on the eve of being married to a
young man who loved her and to whom she was well suited. On account of
some pecuniary questions, and, because my character was then haughty, I
lost the good will of a distant relative, and he threw in my face one
day my dark birth and my infamous ancestry. I thought it a calumny and
demanded satisfaction. The tomb in which so much grief was sleeping was
opened again and the truth came out. I was confounded. To make the
misfortune greater, we had had for some years an old servant who had
always suffered all my caprices without ever leaving us. He contented
himself by weeping and crying while the other servants jested with him.
I do not know how my relative found it out; the fact is that he
summoned this old man before the court and made him tell the truth. The
old servant was my father, who had stuck fast to his dear children and
whom I had maltreated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>many times. Our happiness
disappeared: I renounced our fortune; my sister lost her lover; and
with our father we abandoned the town to go to some other point. The
thought of having contributed to our disgrace and misfortune, cut short
the life of the old man, from whose lips was learned all the sorrowful
past. My sister and I were left alone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She wept a great deal, but, amid
such grief as they piled upon us, she could not forget her love.
Without complaining, without saying a word, she saw her old lover marry
another girl, and I saw her a little later gradually become ill,
without being able to console her. One day she disappeared. In vain I
searched for her everywhere; in vain I asked for her for six months.
Afterward I learned that during the time while I was searching for her,
one day when the water had risen in the lake, there had been found on
the beach at Calamba the body of a girl, either drowned or
assassinated. She had, they say, a knife piercing her breast. The
authorities of Calamba published the fact in the neighboring towns.
Nobody presented himself to claim the body; no young woman had
disappeared. From the description which they gave me afterward, from
the dress, the rings, the beauty of her face and her very abundant
hair, I recognized her as my poor sister. From that time, I have been
wandering from province to province. My fame and history are in the
mouths of many people; they attribute all sorts of deeds to me; at
times they calumniate me; but I take no notice of men and continue on
my way. I have here briefly related my history, and that of a judgment
at the hands of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias became silent and continued rowing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I believe that you are not
wrong,&rdquo; murmured Ibarra, in a low voice, &ldquo;when you say that
justice ought to procure the welfare of the people by lifting up the
criminals and by raising the standard of their morality. Only ... that
is impossible&mdash;a Utopia. And then, where is the money for so many
new employees to come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what are the priests for, the
priests who proclaim peace and charity as their mission? Is it more
meritorious for a priest to wet the head of a child, to give
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>it salt to eat, than to awaken in the darkened
conscience of a criminal that spark, given by God to every man, that he
may seek to do good? Is it more human to accompany a criminal to the
gallows than to accompany him through the difficult path which leads
from vice to virtue? Are not spies, executioners and <i>Guardias
Civiles</i> paid? The latter institution, besides being an evil, also
costs money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My friend, neither you nor I,
although we wish it, can accomplish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Alone we are nothing, it is true.
Take up the cause of the people, unite them, listen to their voices,
give others an example to follow, give them the idea of what is called
a fatherland, a <i>patria</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What the people ask for is
impossible. We must wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To wait, to wait, is equivalent to
suffering!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I should ask it, they would
laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if the people should sustain
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Never! I would never be the one to
lead the multitude and accomplish by force what the Government does not
believe is opportune. No! If I ever saw the multitude armed for such a
purpose, I would put myself on the side of the Government. And I would
fight it, for in such a mob I would not see my country. I wish for its
welfare: that is the reason that I am erecting the school-house. I look
for it through means of instruction, education and progress. Without
light there is no road.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor without fighting is there
liberty,&rdquo; replied Elias.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not care for that kind of
liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Without liberty there is no
light,&rdquo; replied the pilot with enthusiasm. &ldquo;You say that
you know very little about our country. I believe it. You do not see
the fight that is impending. You do not see the cloud on the horizon.
The combat begins in the sphere of ideas, and then descends to the
arena to tinge it with blood. I hear the voice of God. Woe to them who
resist it. History has not been written for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias was transformed. As he stood up, his head uncovered, his manly
face illumined by the moonlight, there was something extraordinary
about him. He shook his long hair and continued: <span class=

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you not see how all is
awakening? Sleep has lasted for centuries, but one day a thunderbolt
will fall and new life will be called forth. New tendencies are
animating the spirits, and these tendencies to-day separated, will be
united some day, and will be guided by God. God has not failed other
peoples, nor will he fail ours. Their cause is liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A solemn silence followed these words. In the meantime, the
<i>banca</i> carried along imperceptibly by the waves, neared the
shore. Elias was the first to break the silence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What have I to say to those who
have sent me?&rdquo; he asked, changing the tone of his voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have already told you that I
greatly deplore their condition, but for them to wait, since evils are
not cured by other evils. In our misfortune, we are all at
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias did not insist further. He bowed his head, continued rowing
and, bringing the <i>banca</i> up to the shore, took leave of Ibarra
saying:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I thank you, Se&ntilde;or, for
your condescension. For your own interests I ask you in the future to
forget me, and never to recognize me in whatever place you may meet
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And saying this, he turned his <i>banca</i> and rowed in the
direction of a dense thicket on the beach. He seemed to observe only
the millions of diamonds which his paddle lifted and which fell back
into the lake, where they soon disappeared in the mystery of the blue
waves.</p>
<p>Finally, he arrived at the place toward which he had been rowing. A
man came out of the thicket and approached him:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What shall I tell the
captain?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell him that Elias, if he does
not die before, will fulfill his word,&rdquo; he replied gloomily.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then when will you meet
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When your captain thinks that the
hour of danger has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All right. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I do not die before,&rdquo;
murmured Elias. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207"

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Changes.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The modest Linares was serious and very uneasy. He had
just received a letter from Do&ntilde;a Victorina which, translated
from the most illiterate Spanish, and omitting its many errors in
spelling and punctuation, was as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Esteemed
Cousin</span>:&mdash;Within three days I want to know from you if you
have killed the <i>alferez</i> or he you. I don&rsquo;t want another
day to pass without this animal being punished. If this length of time
passes and still you have not challenged him, I will tell Don Santiago
that you never were secretary and that you never joked with Canovas or
with General Martinez. I will tell Clarita that it is all a lie and I
will not give you another <i>cuarto</i>. If you challenge him, I
promise you all that you wish. If you do not challenge him, I will
accept no excuses or reasons.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your cousin who loves you in her
heart.<br>
&rdquo;<span class="sc">Victorina de los Reyes de de
Espada&ntilde;a.</span><br>
&ldquo;Sampalog, Monday Eve, 7 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was a serious matter. Linares knew Do&ntilde;a Victorina&rsquo;s
character and knew what she was capable of doing. To reason with her
was out of the question; to beg was useless; to deceive her worse.
There was no other remedy than to challenge.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But what can I do?&rdquo; he said
to himself, as he was walking alone. &ldquo;If he receives me harshly?
If I meet his wife? Who would want to be my second? The curate? Captain
Tiago? Cursed be the hour in which I gave ear to her advice! What will
this se&ntilde;orita say about me? Now I am sorry to have been
secretary to all the ministers.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>The good Linares was in this sad soliloquy when Father Salv&iacute;
arrived. The Franciscan was certainly thinner and paler than usual, but
his eyes shone with a peculiar light and a strange smile was seen on
his lips.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Linares, all
alone?&rdquo; saluted the priest and directed his steps to the
<i>sala</i>, through the half open door of which notes of the piano
were heard.</p>
<p>Linares restrained a smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And Don Santiago?&rdquo; added the
curate.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago presented himself at that moment, kissed the
curate&rsquo;s hand, took the Father&rsquo;s hat and cane and smiled
like one who had been blessed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the
curate, going into the <i>sala</i>, followed by Linares and Captain
Tiago. &ldquo;I have good news from Manila which you will all enjoy. I
have received letters from Manila which confirm the one which
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra brought me yesterday&mdash;so that, Don Santiago,
the impediment is removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara was seated at the piano between her two girl friends.
She half rose to her feet at this remark, but her strength failed her
and she sat down again. Linares turned pale and looked at Captain
Tiago, who turned his eyes to the floor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This young man really seems to me
a very nice fellow,&rdquo; continued the curate. &ldquo;At first, I
judged him bad&mdash;he is a little quick-tempered. But he knows so
well how to atone for his faults afterward, that one cannot hold any
grudge against him. If it were not for Father D&aacute;maso....&rdquo;
And the curate directed a quick glance at Maria Clara. She was
listening to all that was going on but without taking her eyes off the
music&mdash;in spite of the concealed pinches which Sinang gave her to
express her joy. Had she been alone, she would have danced.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso?&rdquo; asked
Linares without finishing the sentence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the curate.
&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso has said that as ... godfather he could not
permit ... but I believe that if finally, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra asks
pardon, which I do not doubt he will do, all will be
arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara arose, made an excuse and retired to her room,
accompanied by Victoria. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if Father D&aacute;maso does
not pardon him?&rdquo; asked Captain Tiago, in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then Maria Clara will see that
Father D&aacute;maso is her spiritual father. But I believe that they
will come to an understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, steps were heard and Ibarra appeared, followed by
Aunt Isabel. His presence on the scene produced a varied effect. He
saluted Captain Tiago affably, the latter not knowing whether to smile
or to weep; to Linares he bowed profoundly. Father Salv&iacute; arose
and extended his hand to him so affectionately that Ibarra could not
suppress a look of surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not think it strange,&rdquo;
said Father Salv&iacute;. &ldquo;I was just paying you a
compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra thanked him and approached Sinang.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where have you been all
day?&rdquo; she asked, with a childish laugh. &ldquo;We have been
asking each other, &lsquo;Where could this soul redeemed from purgatory
have gone?&rsquo; Each one of us gave a different answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And will you not tell what you
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, that is a secret; but I will
surely tell you in private. Now tell us where you have been so that we
can see who has been able to guess it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, that also is a secret; but I
will tell you alone, if the se&ntilde;ores will permit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Certainly, certainly!&rdquo; said
Father Salv&iacute;.</p>
<p>Sinang took Crisostomo to one end of the hall. She was very happy
with the idea of knowing a secret.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell me, my little friend,&rdquo;
said Ibarra, &ldquo;Is Maria angry with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not know, but she says that
it is better that you should forget her and then begins to cry. Captain
Tiago wants her to marry that gentleman; Father D&aacute;maso also
wishes it; but she says neither yes nor no. This morning when we were
asking for you, I said: &lsquo;What if he has gone to make love to some
one else?&rsquo; She replied to me: &lsquo;Would to God that he
had!&rsquo; and then began to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was serious.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell Maria that I want to speak
with her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; asked Sinang,
knitting her eyebrows and looking at him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Entirely alone, no. But so that we
may not be seen by that other se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is difficult, but don&rsquo;t
worry. I will tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And when will I know the
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To-morrow come to the house early.
Maria never wants to be alone. We keep her company. Victoria sleeps by
her side one night, and I the next. To-morrow night it is my turn. But
listen: What is the secret? You are going without telling me the
principal thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is true. I was in the town of
Los Ba&ntilde;os. I went up there to do some business in cocoanut
trees, since I am thinking of building a factory. Your father will be
my partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nothing more than that? Give us
the secret!&rdquo; exclaimed Sinang in a loud voice and in the tone of
a defrauded usurer. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take care. I don&rsquo;t want you
to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have no desire to!&rdquo;
replied Sinang, sticking up her nose. &ldquo;If it were something more
important, I would tell it to my friends. But to buy cocoanuts!
cocoanuts! Who is interested in cocoanuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went away in haste to find her girl friends.</p>
<p>A few moments afterward, Ibarra seeing that the conversation was
lagging, took leave of the gathering. Captain Tiago&rsquo;s expression
was between sweet and sour; Linares was silent and observing; and the
curate, feigning to be joyful, was telling stories. None of the girls
had returned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Playing Cards with the Shades.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A cloudy sky hides the moon, and a cold wind, theomen
of approaching December, whirls the dry leaves and dust in the narrow
path leading to the cemetery.</p>
<p>Under the gate, three forms are conversing in a low tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you spoken to Elias?&rdquo;
asked a voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; you know he is very odd and
discreet. But he ought to be with us. Don Crisostomo saved his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I accepted the offer for the same
reason,&rdquo; said the first voice. &ldquo;Don Crisostomo is having my
wife treated at a doctor&rsquo;s house in Manila. I have agreed to take
charge of the convent in the attack, so that I can settle my accounts
with the curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And we, we will have charge of the
attack on the <i>cuartel</i>, so that we can say to the members of the
<i>Guardia Civil</i> that our father had sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How many will there be of
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Five! Five will be enough. Don
Crisostomo&rsquo;s servant says that there will be twenty in
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if things don&rsquo;t turn out
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;St!&rdquo; said one, and they all
became silent.</p>
<p>In the semi-darkness, a form could be seen crawling along the fence.
From time to time it stopped, as if to look behind.</p>
<p>And it did so not without reason. Behind, at some twenty paces, came
another form. This one was taller and seemed to be darker than the
first. Each time that the first stopped this second one would disappear
as if the earth had swallowed it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They are following me,&rdquo;
murmured the one ahead. &ldquo;Is it a <i>Guardia Civil?</i> Has the
sacristan lied?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It appears that the appointment is
here,&rdquo; said the second, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212"
href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>in a low voice. &ldquo;They
are up to something bad, when the two brothers hide it from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first form finally arrived at the gate of the cemetery. The
three who were already there advanced.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us separate. Some one is
following me. To-morrow we will have the arms and to-morrow night will
be our time. The cry is &lsquo;Viva Don Crisostomo!&rsquo;
Begone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three persons disappeared behind the wall. The recent arrival
hid himself in the hollow of the gate and waited silently.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who is following
me!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>The second person came along very cautiously, and stopped to look
around.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have arrived late!&rdquo; said
he in a half intelligible voice. &ldquo;But perhaps they will
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as a fine rain began to fall and threatened to continue, he
took refuge under the gate. Naturally, he met the other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! who are you?&rdquo; asked the
one who had just come up, in a manly voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; replied
the other tranquilly.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Each tried to recognize the other
by the tone of his voice and to distinguish the other&rsquo;s
features.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you waiting here
for?&rdquo; asked the one with the heavy voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Till the clock strikes eight, so
as to have a game of cards with the dead. I want to win some money
to-night,&rdquo; replied the other, in an ordinary tone. &ldquo;And
you: what do you come here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;for the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well! I am glad. So I will not be
without a companion. I have brought some cards. At the first stroke of
the bell, I put down the <i>albur</i> (the first two cards put on the
board in monte). At the second stroke, I put down the <i>gallo</i> (the
second pair). The cards which move after I have put them down, are
those which the dead choose for themselves. Did you also bring some
cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is simple. Just as you act as
&lsquo;banker&rsquo; for them, so I hope that they will
&lsquo;bank&rsquo; for me.&rdquo; (In monte the banker deals the cards
and bets that one of the cards in either the <i>albur</i> or
<i>gallo</i> is turned up by dealing off the pack, before the card
chosen by the other person is turned up. A banker can play against two
others.)</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if the shades do not care to
&lsquo;bank&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What can be done? The game is not
obligatory upon the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you come armed? What if you
have to fight with the shades of the dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use my fists,&rdquo;
replied the taller of the two.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! The devil! Now, I remember!
The dead do not bet when there is more than one live person around.
There are two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is that true? Well, I don&rsquo;t
want to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor I. I need some money,&rdquo;
replied the smaller one. &ldquo;But let us do this: We will decide by
the cards which one shall go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; replied the
other, showing a certain amount of displeasure.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then let us go in. Have you any
matches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the cemetery and in the obscurity they searched for a
place where they might decide the question with the cards. They soon
found a niche upon which they sat down. The shorter one took from his
hat some playing cards and the other lighted a match.</p>
<p>Each one looked at the other in the light which the match made, but,
judging from the expression on their faces, they did not recognize each
other. However, we can recognize in the taller one, the one with the
manly voice, Elias; and in the smaller one, Lucas, with the scar on his
cheek.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cut the cards!&rdquo; said the
latter, without ceasing to look at the other.</p>
<p>He pushed aside some bones which were found on the niche and turned
up an ace and a jack for the <i>albur</i>. Elias lighted one match
after another.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;On the jack!&rdquo; said he and,
in order to show which of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>the cards he was betting on, he
placed upon it a piece of vertebr&aelig;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I deal!&rdquo; said Lucas and,
after turning up four or five cards, an ace came up.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have lost,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Now leave me alone so that I may win some money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias, without saying a word, disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>Some minutes afterward, the clock in the church struck eight and the
bell announced the hour of prayer. But Lucas did not invite anybody to
play with him. He did not call out the shades, as superstition
demanded. Instead, he uncovered his head, murmured some prayers and
crossed himself with the same fervor as the chief of the Brotherhood of
the Most Sacred Rosary would have done at that moment.</p>
<p>The drizzling rain continued all night. At nine o&rsquo;clock the
streets were dark and lonely. The little cocoanut oil lanterns, which
each citizen had to hang out in front of his house gave light scarcely
a meter around. It seemed as though they had been lighted so one might
see the darkness.</p>
<p>Two Civil Guards were walking from one side of the street to the
other near the church.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is cold,&rdquo; said one in
Tagalog with a Visayan accent. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t catching any
sacristans. There is nobody to clean out the <i>alferez&rsquo;s</i> hen
yard and we ought to catch some sacristan and make him do it. Since
that one was killed, they have taken warning. I am getting tired of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;Nobody commits any robbery; no one disturbs the peace; but,
thank God, they say that Elias is in town. The <i>alferez</i> says that
the one who catches him will be free from whippings for three
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! Do you know his identification
marks?&rdquo; asked the Visayan.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I certainly do! Stature, tall,
according to the <i>alferez&rsquo;s</i> description; ordinary,
according to the description of Father D&aacute;maso; color, brunette;
eyes, black; nose, regular; mouth, regular; beard, none; hair,
black.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! And particular marks?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Camisa</i>, black; pantaloons,
black; a wood-cutter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! He will not escape. I think I
see him already.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t confuse him with
anybody else, although you might think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both soldiers continued their beats.</p>
<p>By the light of the lantern two forms could again be seen, one
following the other cautiously. A forcible &ldquo;<i lang="es">Quien
vive?</i>&rdquo; stops them both. The first one replied &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Espa&ntilde;a</i>,&rdquo; in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>The two soldiers drag him along and bring him up to the light, to
recognize him. It was Lucas, but the soldiers were in doubt and
questioned each other with a glance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The <i>alferez</i> said nothing
about his having a scar,&rdquo; said the Visayan in a low voice.
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To order a mass for
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you not seen
Elias?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not know him,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Lucas.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You dunce! I am not asking if you
know him. Nor do we know him. I am asking you if you have seen
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen closely. I will give you
his description. Stature, at times tall, at times regular; skin and
eyes, black; all the others are regular,&rdquo; said the Visayan.
&ldquo;Do you know him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Lucas, frightened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, <i>sulung</i>! (Go along).
You brute! You ass!&rdquo; And they gave him a shove.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know why Elias is tall,
according to the <i>alferez</i>, and why he is short, according to the
curate?&rdquo; asked the <span class="corr" id="xd21e6033" title=
"Source: Tagalo">Tagalog</span> of the other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because the <i>alferez</i> was
stuck in a mud hole when he observed him, and the curate was on foot
when he saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
exclaimed the Visayan. &ldquo;You are bright. Why are you a <i>Guardia
Civil</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been always. I was
a smuggler at one time,&rdquo; replied the Tagalog boastingly.</p>
<p>But another form attracted their attention. They called out
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Quien Vive?</i>&rdquo; and brought him up to the
light. This time it was Elias himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am pursuing, se&ntilde;or, a man
who has whipped and threatened my brother. He has a scar on his face
and his name is Elias&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ha?&rdquo; exclaimed the two, and
looked at each other frightened.</p>
<p>And at once they started on a run toward the church, where a few
minutes before Lucas had disappeared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The bell announces the hour of evening prayer. On
hearing the religious sound, all stop, leave their work and uncover
their heads; the laborer, coming from the fields on the
<i>carabao&rsquo;s</i> back, suspends the song to which the animal
keeps step, and prays; the women in the middle of the street make the
sign of the cross, and move their lips with affectation so that no one
may doubt their devotion: the man stops fondling his game-cock and
recites the Angelus so that he may have good luck; in the houses, they
pray in a loud voice ... every sound which is not a part of the <i>Ave
Maria</i> is dissipated, silenced.</p>
<p>However, the curate, without his hat, hastily crosses the street,
scandalizing many old women. And still more scandalous, he directs his
steps towards the <i>alferez&rsquo;s</i> house. The devout women think
that it is time for them to stop the movement of their lips and to kiss
the curate&rsquo;s hand, but Father Salv&iacute; takes no notice of
them. To-day he finds no pleasure in placing his bony hand under a
Christian&rsquo;s nose. Some important business must be occupying him
that he should so forget his own interests and those of the Church!</p>
<p>He goes up the stairs and knocks impatiently at the
<i>alferez&rsquo;s</i> door. The latter appears, his eyebrows knit and
followed by his better half, who smiles malignantly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, Father Curate! I was just
going to see you. Your he-goat....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have a most important
matter....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow your goat to
go on breaking down my fence.... I&rsquo;ll shoot him if he gets in
there again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is if you are alive
to-morrow,&rdquo; said the curate, breathless, and directing himself
toward the <i>sala</i>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! do you think that that
seven-months-old puppy will kill me? I&rsquo;ll kick him to
pieces.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute; stepped back and looked instinctively at the
feet of the <i>alferez</i>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Whom are you talking about?&rdquo;
asked he, trembling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Of whom could I be talking but
that big blockhead who proposes to challenge me to a duel with
revolvers at one hundred paces?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the curate, and
added: &ldquo;I have come to speak about a most urgent matter which
seriously concerns the life of all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Seriously!&rdquo; repeated the
<i>alferez</i>, turning pale in turn. &ldquo;Does this young fellow
shoot well...?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am not speaking about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friar pointed to the door which the a<i>lferez</i> shut in his
customary manner, by a kick. The a<i>lferez</i> usually found his hands
superfluous. An imprecation and a groan from without were heard.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You brute. You have cut open my
head!&rdquo; cried his wife.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now unbosom yourself,&rdquo; said
he to the curate in a quiet manner. The latter looked at him for some
time. Afterward he asked, in that nasal and monotonous priest&rsquo;s
voice:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you see how I came
running?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Umph! I thought something was the
matter with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When I leave my duties in this
manner there are grave motives.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what is it?&rdquo; asked the
other, stamping his foot on the floor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Calm yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, why did you come in such a
hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate approached him and asked in a mysterious way:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;you&mdash;know&mdash;anything&mdash;new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You confess that you know
absolutely nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! do you mean to tell me about
Elias, whom your sacristan mayor hid last night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, no! I don&rsquo;t speak of
such matters now,&rdquo; replied the curate, in a bad humor. &ldquo;I
am talking about a great danger.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then d&mdash;&mdash;n it! Let it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said the friar
slowly and with a certain disdain, &ldquo;you will see again how
important we priests are. The lowest layman is worth a regiment, so
that a curate....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then lowering his voice in a very mysterious manner:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have discovered a great
conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> started and looked at the friar astonished.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A terrible and well-laid
conspiracy, which is to break out this very night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This very night!&rdquo; exclaimed
the <i>alferez</i>, moving at first toward Father Salv&iacute;, and
then running after his revolver and saber, which were hanging on the
wall: &ldquo;Whom shall I arrest? Whom shall I arrest?&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Be calm. It is not yet time,
thanks to my great haste. At eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot them
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen! This afternoon a woman,
whose name I must not mention (it is a secret of the confessional) came
to me and disclosed it all. At eight o&rsquo;clock they will take the
<i>cuartel</i> by surprise, sack the convent, seize the
Government&rsquo;s steamboat and assassinate all the
Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> was stupified.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The woman has not told more than
that,&rdquo; added the curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Has not told you more? Then
I&rsquo;ll arrest her!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; I cannot consent to it. The
tribunal of penitence is the throne of God of forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Neither God nor forgiveness count
in this matter. I&rsquo;ll arrest her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are losing your head. What you
ought to do is to prepare yourself. Arm your soldiers quietly and put
them in ambush. Send me four Guards for the convent and notify the
people on the Government steamboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The boat is not here. I&rsquo;ll
send to other sections for aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They would notice that and would
not go on with their plans. No, don&rsquo;t do that. What is important
is that we catch them alive and make them talk; I say, you will make
them disclose the conspiracy. I, in the capacity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>of a
priest, ought not to mix myself in these matters. Now&rsquo;s your
chance! Here you can win crosses and stars. I ask only that you make it
evident that I am the one who warned you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It will be made evident, Father,
it will be made evident! And perhaps a mitre will fall to you!&rdquo;
replied the radiant <i>alferez</i>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Be sure and send me four
un-uniformed Civil Guards, eh? Be discreet! To-night at eight
o&rsquo;clock, it will rain stars and crosses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was going on, a man came running down the road which led
to Ibarra&rsquo;s house, and quickly went up the stairs.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is the Se&ntilde;or at
home?&rdquo; asked Elias of the servant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is in his laboratory at
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, in order to pass the time while he impatiently waited for
the hour when he could make explanations to Maria Clara, had gone to
work in his cabinet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, is it you, Elias?&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;I was thinking about you. Yesterday, I forgot to ask
you for the name of that Spaniard in whose house your grandfather
lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother yourself,
Se&ntilde;or, about me....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; continued Ibarra,
without noting the agitation of the young man, and putting a piece of
bamboo to a flame. &ldquo;I have made a great discovery. This bamboo is
incombustible....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about bamboo now,
Se&ntilde;or. Talk about collecting your papers and fleeing in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him surprised, and, on seeing the seriousness in
Elias&rsquo;s countenance, he dropped the object which he had in his
hands.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Burn everything that can possibly
implicate you in any way and put yourself in a more secure place within
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what for?&rdquo; he asked at
last.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Put all that you have of value in
a secure place....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Burn all papers written by you or
to you. The most innocent can be interpreted in a bad sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What for? Because I have just
discovered a conspiracy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=
"#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>which will be attributed to you in
order to ruin you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A conspiracy? And who has planned
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have been unable to learn the
author of it. Only a moment ago I was talking with one of the
unfortunate men who have been paid for it. I could not dissuade
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t that fellow say
who paid him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes. Asking me to keep the secret,
he told me that it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra.
He stood stupefied.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, don&rsquo;t
hesitate, don&rsquo;t doubt, don&rsquo;t lose time, for undoubtedly the
conspiracy will break out this very night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, with staring eyes, and hands holding his head, seemed not to
hear him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The blow cannot be
thwarted,&rdquo; continued Elias. &ldquo;I have arrived too late. I do
not know their leaders ... save yourself, Se&ntilde;or, save yourself
for the sake of your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where shall I flee? They are
expecting me this evening,&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra, thinking of Maria
Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To any other town, to Manila, to
the house of some official; only flee somewhere so that they will not
say that you are directing the movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if I myself denounce the
conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You denounce it?&rdquo; exclaimed
Elias, looking at him, and stepping back. &ldquo;You would pass for a
traitor and a coward in the eyes of the conspirators, and for a
pusillanimous person in the eyes of others. They would say that you had
played a trick to win some praise, they would say....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But what can be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Already I have told you. Destroy
all the papers you have which relate to you; flee and await
developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And Maria Clara?&rdquo; exclaimed
the young man. &ldquo;No; death first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias wrung his hands and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, then, at least avoid the
blow. Prepare yourself against their accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked around him in a stupefied manner.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, help me! There in those bags
I have my family <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>letters. Sort out those from my father,
which are, perhaps, the ones that would incriminate me. Read the
signatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, stunned and overwhelmed, opened and closed drawers,
collected papers, hastily read letters, tore up some, kept others, took
down books and thumbed through some of them. Elias did the same, if
indeed with less confusion, with equal zeal. But he stopped, with eyes
wide open, turned over a paper which he had in his hand and asked in a
trembling voice:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did your family know Don Pedro
Eibarramendia?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; replied Ibarra,
opening a drawer and taking out a pile of papers. &ldquo;He was my
great-grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your great grandfather? Don Pedro
Eibarramendia?&rdquo; he again asked, with livid features and a changed
appearance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ibarra,
distracted. &ldquo;We cut short the name, for it was too
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He was a Basque?&rdquo; said Elias
approaching him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes; but what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; he asked, surprised.</p>
<p>Elias closed his fist, shook it in Ibarra&rsquo;s face and looked at
him. Crisostomo stepped back as soon as he read the expression on that
face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know who Don Pedro
Eibarramendia was?&rdquo; he asked between his teeth. &ldquo;Don Pedro
Eibarramendia was that wretch who accused my grandfather and caused all
our misery.... I was looking for one of his name. God has given you
into my hands.... Account to me for our misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him terrified. Elias shook him by the arm and, in a
bitter voice, filled with hate, said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look at me well; see if I have
suffered, and you, you live, you love, you have fortune, home,
consideration. You live ... you live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, beside himself, he ran toward a small collection of arms, but
he had scarcely grasped two swords when he let them fall, and, like a
madman, looked at Ibarra, who remained immovable.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; he said
and fled from the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Catastrophe.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There in the dining-room Captain Tiago, Linares, and
Aunt Isabel were eating supper. In the <i>sala</i> the rattling of
plate and tableware was heard. Maria Clara had said that she did not
care to eat and had seated herself at the piano. By her side was jolly
Sinang, who murmured little secrets in Maria&rsquo;s ear, while Father
Salv&iacute; uneasily paced the <i>sala</i>.</p>
<p>It was not because the convalescent had no appetite that she was not
eating. It was because she was awaiting the arrival of a certain person
and had taken advantage of the moment in which her Argus could not be
present, the hour when Linares ate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will see how that ghost will
stay till eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; murmured Sinang, pointing to the
curate. &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock <i>he</i> ought to come. This
priest is as much in love as Linares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara looked at her friend, frightened. The latter, without
noticing her expression, continued her terrible gossip:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! Now I know why he
doesn&rsquo;t go, in spite of all my hints. He doesn&rsquo;t want to
burn the lamps in the convent. Don&rsquo;t you see? Ever since you fell
ill, he has had the two lights which he used to burn, put out. But look
at his eyes and his face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment the clock in the house struck eight. The curate
trembled and went and sat down in a corner of the room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is coming,&rdquo; said Sinang,
pinching Maria Clara. &ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell in the church tolled eight and all arose to pray. Father
Salv&iacute;, with a weak and trembling voice, led, but, as each one
had his own thoughts, nobody paid any attention to him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prayer had scarcely ended, when Ibarra presented himself. The
young man was wearing mourning, not only in his dress, but in his face.
In fact, it was so evident that Maria Clara, on seeing him, arose and
took a step toward him as if to ask what ailed him, but at the same
instant a discharge of musketry was heard. Ibarra stopped, his eyes
rolled and he was unable to speak. The curate hid himself behind a
pillar. More shooting and more noise was heard in the direction of the
convent, followed by cries and the sound of people running. Captain
Tiago, Aunt Isabel and Linares entered the room, hurriedly crying
&ldquo;<i lang="es">tulisan! tulisan!</i>&rdquo; Andeng followed them,
brandishing a spit and ran toward her foster sister.</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel fell on her knees and prayed the <i>Kyrie eleison</i>.
Captain Tiago, pale and trembling, carried a chicken&rsquo;s liver on
his fork, and, in tears, offered it to the Virgin of Antipolo. Linares
had his mouth full and was armed with a spoon. Sinang and Maria Clara
embraced each other. The only person who did not move was Ibarra. He
stood as if petrified, his face indescribably pale.</p>
<p>The cries and blows continued, the windows were shut with a bang, a
whistle was heard, and occasionally a shot.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Christe eleison!</i> Santiago,
fasten the windows,&rdquo; groaned Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fifty great bombs and a
thanksgiving mass,&rdquo; replied Captain Tiago. &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Ora pro nobis!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a time, things quieted down and there was a terrible silence.
The voice of the <i>alferez</i> was distinguished, as he came running
in, and crying: &ldquo;Father curate! Father Salv&iacute;!
Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Misere!</i> The <i>alferez</i>
is asking for confession!&rdquo; cried Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is he wounded?&rdquo; asked
Linares at last. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, Father Salv&iacute;! There
is nothing to fear now,&rdquo; continued the <i>alferez</i>,
shouting.</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute;, pale, and decided at last, came out of his
hiding-place and went downstairs.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The <i>tulisanes</i> have killed
the <i>alferez</i>!&rdquo; said Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria Clara, Sinang, go to your
room! Fasten the door! <i>Kyrie eleison!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra also went toward the stairs, in spite of Aunt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>Isabel, who was saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go
out! You haven&rsquo;t confessed yet. Don&rsquo;t go out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good old woman had been a great friend of Ibarra&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>But Ibarra left the house. It seemed to him that all about him was
revolving through the air, that even the ground was gone from under his
feet. His ears buzzed. His legs moved heavily and irregularly. Waves of
blood, light and darkness, succeeded one another on the retina of his
eye.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the moon was shining brightly in the heavens,
the young man stumbled on every stone in the solitary and deserted
street.</p>
<p>Near the <i>cuartel</i> he saw some soldiers with their bayonets
fixed, talking excitedly. He passed by unseen.</p>
<p>In the tribunal, blows, cries, wails, and curses were heard. The
<i>alferez&rsquo;s</i> voice drowned all the others.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Put him in the stocks! Put
handcuffs on that fellow! Two shots for whoever moves! Sergeant, you
will mount your guard! Let no one pass, not even God! Corporal, let no
one sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra hastened his steps toward his house. His servants were
uneasily awaiting him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Saddle the best horse and go to
bed!&rdquo; said he to them.</p>
<p>He entered his laboratory and hurriedly began to get his travelling
bag ready. He opened an iron box, took out all the money which he found
there and put it in a bag. He gathered his jewels together, took down a
picture of Maria Clara which was hanging upon the wall, and, arming
himself with a dirk and two revolvers, he turned to the cupboard where
he had some tools.</p>
<p>At that instant, three blows, loud and strong, sounded on the
door.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra, in a doleful voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Open in the name of the King! Open
the door at once, or we will knock it down!&rdquo; replied an imperious
Spanish voice.</p>
<p>Ibarra looked toward the window. His eyes flashed and he cocked his
revolver. But changing his mind, he left the arms and went to open the
door at the same moment that the servants came up. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>Three Guards seized him instantly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are made a prisoner in the
name of the King!&rdquo; said the sergeant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They will tell you later. We are
prohibited from saying a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man reflected a moment and not wishing, perhaps, the
soldiers to discover his preparations for flight, he took his hat and
said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am at your disposal. I suppose
it will be only for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you promise not to escape, we
will not handcuff you. The <i>alferez</i> grants this favor, but if you
flee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra followed, leaving the servants in consternation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what had become of Elias?</p>
<p>On leaving Crisostomo&rsquo;s house, like a madman, he ran about
without knowing where. He crossed fields, and in violent agitation
arrived at a forest. He was fleeing from people, and from light. The
moon troubled him and he entered the mysterious shade of the forest.
Sometimes stopping, sometimes following unbroken paths, leaning upon
century-old trunks, entangled in the briars, he looked toward the town,
which lay at his feet bathed in the light of the moon, stretching
itself out on the plain, lying on the shore of the lake. Birds,
disturbed in their sleep, flew away. Owls screeched and flew from one
limb to another. But Elias neither heard nor saw them. He thought he
was being followed by the infuriated shades of his ancestors. He saw
the horrible basket hanging from every branch with the blood-covered
head of B&aacute;lat, just as his father had described it to him. He
thought he saw the dead body of his grandmother lying at the foot of
every tree. He seemed to see the skeleton of his dishonored grandfather
in the darkness, and the skeleton, the old woman, and the head all
cried out to him, &ldquo;Coward! Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the mountain and fled down toward the sea. He ran along the
beach in agitation. But there in the distance, amid the waves, where
the light of the moon seemed to raise a fog, he thought he saw a shade
raise itself, the shade of his sister, with her breast covered with
blood, her hair hanging loose in the air. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>Elias fell upon his knees on the sand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you, too!&rdquo; he cried
stretching out his arms.</p>
<p>Then, with his eyes fixed on the fog, he arose slowly and, advancing
toward it, went into the water as if to follow somebody. He waded on
over the gentle slope of the beach which forms the bar. He was already
far from the shore and the water was up to his belt. He went on and on,
as if fascinated by a seducing spirit. The water was now up to his
breast. Suddenly, the discharge of musketry awoke him from his dream,
the vision disappeared, and the young man returned to reality. He
stopped, reflected, and noticed that he was in the water. The lake was
smooth and he could still see the lights in the fishermen&rsquo;s
huts.</p>
<p>He returned to the shore and made his way toward the town. What for?
He himself did not know.</p>
<p>The town seemed uninhabited. The houses were all closed. Even the
animals, the dogs which are accustomed to bark at night, had hid
themselves through fear. The silvery light of the moon increased the
sadness and solitude.</p>
<p>Afraid of meeting the Civil Guards, he went through the orchards and
gardens. In one of the gardens he thought he saw two human forms, but
he continued his way. Jumping over fences and walls, he arrived after
great labor at the other side of the town, and directed his steps
toward Ibarra&rsquo;s house. The servants were in the door, lamenting
and commenting on the arrest of their master.</p>
<p>Aware of what had passed, Elias went away, but returned to the
house, leaped over the wall, crawled through a window and went into the
cabinet or laboratory, where the candle which Ibarra had left was still
burning.</p>
<p>Elias saw the papers and the books. He found the arms and the little
sacks which contained the money and the jewelry. All that had passed
ran through his imagination again, and, seeing all the papers which
might incriminate Ibarra, he thought of collecting them, throwing them
through the window and burying them.</p>
<p>He glanced toward the garden and, by the light of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>moon, he saw two Civil Guards coming with an
adjutant. Their bayonets and helmets were glistening in the light.</p>
<p>Then he decided. He piled up the clothes and papers in the middle of
the cabinet, emptied the oil in a lamp upon the pile and set fire to
it. He quickly buckled the arms around him. He saw the picture of Maria
Clara, hesitated&mdash;put it in one of the little sacks, and jumped
out of the window with them all.</p>
<p>It was already time, for the two Civil Guards were forcing their
entrance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us go up to get your
master&rsquo;s papers,&rdquo; said the adjutant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you permission? If not, you
shall not go up!&rdquo; said an old servant.</p>
<p>But the soldiers pushed the servants aside with the butts of their
guns and went upstairs. A thick smoke was already filling the whole
house, and gigantic tongues of flame were coming out from the
<i>sala</i>, licking the doors and windows.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo; they all
cried.</p>
<p>Each hurried to save what he could, but the fire had filled the
small laboratory, breaking out furiously among the inflammable
materials. The Civil Guards had to turn back. The fire, roaring and
sweeping all before it, closed the passage to them. In vain they
brought water from the well. All were shouting, and crying for help,
but they were isolated. The fire reached the other rooms and in thick
columns of smoke ascended to the heavens. Some peasants came from a
distance, but they arrived only in time to see the frightful spectacle,
the end of that old building, so long respected by the elements.

<h2 class="main">What People Say and Think.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Day dawned at last for the terrorized people. The
streets in which the <i>cuartel</i> and the tribunal were situated were
still deserted and solitary. The houses showed no signs of life.
However, a shutter was opened with a creaking noise and an infant head
stuck out and looked in all directions.... Slap!... A sound announces
hard contact between a strip of leather and a human body. The child
made a grimace, closed its eyes and disappeared. The shutter was closed
again.</p>
<p>The example had been set. Without any doubt the opening and closing
of the shutter has been heard, for another window was opened very
slowly and cautiously and a wrinkled and toothless old woman thrust out
her head. She was called Sister Rut&eacute;. She looked about, knit her
brows, spit noisily and then crossed herself. In the house opposite, a
little window was timidly opened and her friend, Sister Rufa appeared.
They looked at each other for a moment, smiled, made some signals, and
again crossed themselves.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> It was like a
thanksgiving mass,&rdquo; said Sister Rufa.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Since the time that B&aacute;lat
sacked the town I have never seen a night like it,&rdquo; replied
Sister Put&eacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a lot of shots! They say that
it was old Pablo&rsquo;s gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Tulisanes?</i> It
couldn&rsquo;t be. They say that it was the <i>cuaderilleros</i>
against the Civil Guards. For this reason, they have arrested Don
Filipo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i lang="la">Sanctus Deus!</i>
They say that there are no less than fourteen killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other windows were opened and different faces appeared, exchanging
salutations and commenting on the affair.</p>
<p>In the light of the day&mdash;which promised to be a splendid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>one&mdash;could be seen in the distance, like
ash-colored shadows, soldiers hurrying about in confusion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There goes another corpse!&rdquo;
said some one from one of the windows.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;One? I see two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And so do I. But do you know what
it was?&rdquo; asked a man with a crafty face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Certainly. The
<i>cuaderilleros</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, Se&ntilde;or. An uprising at
the <i>cuartel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What uprising? The curate against
the <i>alferez</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, nothing of the sort,&rdquo;
said he who had asked the question. &ldquo;The Chinese have risen in
revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he closed his window again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Chinese!&rdquo; repeated all,
with the greatest astonishment.</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour other versions of the affair were in
circulation. Ibarra, with his servants, it was said, had tried to steal
Maria Clara, and Captain Tiago, aided by the <i>Guardia Civil</i> had
defended her.</p>
<p>By this time the number of the dead was no longer fourteen, but
thirty. Captain Tiago, it was said, was wounded and was going right off
to Manila with his family.</p>
<p>The arrival of two <i>cuaderilleros</i>, carrying a human form in a
wheelbarrow, and followed by a Civil Guard, produced a great sensation.
It was supposed that they came from the convent. From the form of the
feet which were hanging down, they tried to guess who it could be. By
half-past seven, when other Civil Guards arrived from neighboring
towns, the current version of the affair was already clear and
detailed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have just come from the
tribunal, where I have seen Don Filipo and Don Crisostomo
prisoners,&rdquo; said a man to Sister Put&eacute;. &ldquo;I talked
with one of the <i>cuaderilleros</i> on guard. Well, Bruno, the son of
the man who was whipped to death, made a declaration last night. As you
know, Captain Tiago is going to marry his daughter to a Spaniard. Don
Crisostomo, offended, wanted to take revenge and tried to kill all the
Spaniards, even the curate. Last night they attacked the convent and
the <i>cuartel</i>. Happily, by mercy of God, the curate was in Captain
Tiago&rsquo;s house. They say that many escaped. The Civil <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>Guards burned Don Crisostomo&rsquo;s house, and
if they had not taken him prisoner, they would have burned him,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They burned the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All the servants were arrested.
Why, you can still see the smoke from here!&rdquo; said the narrator,
approaching the window. &ldquo;Those who come from there relate very
sad things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All looked toward the place indicated. A light column of smoke was
still ascending to the heavens. All made comments more or less pious,
more or less accusatory.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Poor young man!&rdquo; exclaimed
an old man, the husband of Put&eacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; replied his wife.
&ldquo;But he did not order a mass for the soul of his father, who
undoubtedly needs it more than others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But wife, you don&rsquo;t have any
pity....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sympathy for the excommunicated?
It is a sin to have pity for the enemies of God, say the curates.
Don&rsquo;t you remember? He ran over the sacred burial ground as if he
were in a cattle pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But a cattle pen and a cemetery
are much alike,&rdquo; responded the old man, &ldquo;except that but
one class of animals enter the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Sister
Put&eacute;. &ldquo;Are you still going to defend him whom God so
clearly punishes? You will see that they will arrest you, too. You may
support a falling house, if you want to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband became silent in view of this argument.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the old
woman, &ldquo;after striking Father D&aacute;maso, there was nothing
left for him to do but to kill Father Salv&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t deny that he
was a good boy when he was a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, he was a good child,&rdquo;
replied the old woman, &ldquo;but he went to Spain. All those who go to
Spain return heretics, so the curates say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the husband,
seeing his revenge. &ldquo;And the curate, and all the curates, and the
Archbishops, and the Pope, and the Virgin&mdash;are they not Spaniards?
Bah! Are they heretics, too? Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily for Sister Put&eacute;, the arrival of a servant, who rushed
in confused and pale, cut off the discussion. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A man hanged in a neighboring
orchard!&rdquo; she exclaimed breathless.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A man hanged!&rdquo; exclaimed
all, full of amazement.</p>
<p>The women crossed themselves. No one could stir.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
continued the servant, trembling. &ldquo;I was going to gather some
peas in.... I looked into the orchard next door ... to see if there ...
I saw a man swinging.... I thought it was Teo ... I went nearer to
gather peas, and I saw that it was not he but it was another, and was
dead ... I ran, ran and....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us go and see it,&rdquo; said
the old man, rising. &ldquo;Take us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; cried
Sister Put&eacute;, seizing him by the shirt.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get into trouble! He
has hanged himself? Then all the worse for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me see it, wife! Go to the
tribunal, Juan, and report it. Perhaps he is not dead yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went ino[typo, should be into?] the orchard, followed by the
servant, who kept hid behind him. The women and Sister Put&eacute;
herself came along behind, full of terror and curiosity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There it is, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
said the servant stopping him and pointing with her finger.</p>
<p>The group stopped at a respectful distance, allowing the old man to
advance alone.</p>
<p>The body of a man, hanging from the limb of a <i>santol</i> tree,
was swinging slowly in the breeze. The old man contemplated it for some
time. He looked at the rigid feet, the arms, the stained clothing and
the drooping head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We ought not to touch the corpse
until some official has arrived,&rdquo; said he, in a loud voice.
&ldquo;He is already stiff. He has been dead for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women approached hesitatingly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is the neighbor who lived in
that little house; the one who arrived only two weeks ago. Look at the
scar on his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ave Maria!&rdquo; exclaimed some
of the women.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Shall we pray for his soul?&rdquo;
asked a young girl as soon as she had finished looking at the dead body
from all directions.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You fool! You heretic!&rdquo;
Sister Put&eacute; scolded her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what Father
D&aacute;maso said? To pray for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233"
href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>a damned person is to tempt
God. He who commits suicide is irrevocably condemned. For this reason,
he cannot be buried in a sacred place. I had begun to think that this
man was going to have a bad ending. I never could guess what he lived
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I saw him twice speaking with the
sacristan mayor,&rdquo; observed a girl.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been to
confess himself or to order a mass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbors gathered together and a large circle surrounded the
corpse which was still swinging. In half an hour some officers and two
<i>cuaderilleros</i> arrived. They took the body down and put it in a
wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Some people are in a hurry to
die,&rdquo; said one of the officers, laughing, while he took out the
pen from behind his ear.</p>
<p>He asked some trifling questions; took the declaration of the
servant, whom he tried to implicate, now looking at her with evil in
his eyes, now threatening her and now attributing to her words which
she did not say&mdash;so much so that the servant, believing that she
was going to be taken to jail, began to weep and finished by declaring
that she was looking for peas, but that ... and she called Teo to
witness.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a peasant with a wide hat and a large plaster on
his neck, was examining the body, and the rope by which it was
hanging.</p>
<p>The face was no more livid than the rest of the body. Above the rope
could be seen two scars and two small bruises. Where the rope had
rubbed, there was no blood and the skin was white. The curious peasant
examined closely the <i>camisa</i> and the pantaloons. He noted that
they were full of dust and recently torn in some places. But what most
attracted his attention were the &ldquo;stick-tights&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6711src" href="#xd21e6711" name="xd21e6711src">1</a>
on his clothing, even up to his neck.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; asked the
officer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was trying to identify him,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; stammered the peasant, lowering his hat further
from his uncovered head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href=
"#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you heard that
it was one Lucas? Were you sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All began to laugh. The peasant, embarrassed, muttered a few words,
and went away with head down, walking slowly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Here! Where are you going?&rdquo;
cried the old man. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out that way.
That&rsquo;s the way to the dead man&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That fellow is still
asleep,&rdquo; said the officer with a jeer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
throw some water on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those standing around laughed again.</p>
<p>The peasant left the place where he had played so poor a part and
directed his steps toward the church. In the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6735" title="Source: sacristry">sacristy</span>, he asked for the
sacristan mayor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is still sleeping!&rdquo; they
replied gruffly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that they sacked the
convent last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I will wait till he
awakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sacristans looked at him with that rudeness characteristic of
people who are in the habit of being ill-treated.</p>
<p>In a dark corner, the one-eyed sacristan mayor was sleeping in a
large chair. His spectacles were across his forehead among his long
locks of hair. His squalid, bony breast was bare, and rose and fell
with regularity.</p>
<p>The peasant sat down near by, disposed to wait patiently, but a coin
fell on the floor and he began looking for it with the aid of a candle,
under the sacristan mayor&rsquo;s big chair. The peasant also noted
&ldquo;stick-tights&rdquo; on the sleeping man&rsquo;s pantaloons and
on the arms of his <i>camisa</i>. The sacristan awoke at last, rubbed
his good eye, and, in a very bad humor, reproached the man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I would like to order a mass said,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied he in a tone of excuse.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They have already finished all the
masses,&rdquo; said the one-eyed man, softening his accent a little.
&ldquo;If you want it for to-morrow.... Is it for souls in
Purgatory?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or;&rdquo; replied
the peasant, giving him a <i>peso</i>.</p>
<p>And looking fixedly in his one eye, he added:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is for a person who is going to
die soon.&rdquo; And he left the sacristy. &ldquo;I could have seized
him last night,&rdquo; he added, sighingly as he removed the plaster
from his neck. And he straightened up and regained the stature and
appearance of Elias. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Civil Guards were passing with a sinister air to and
fro in front of the door of the tribunal, threatening with the butts of
their guns the daring boys who stood on tip-toe or raised each other up
in order to look through the grates in the windows.</p>
<p>The <i>sala</i> did not present that same joyful aspect as it did
when the program for the festival was being discussed. It was gloomy
and the silence was almost death-like. The Civil Guards and the
<i>cuaderilleros</i> who were occupying the room scarcely spoke and the
few words that they did pronounce were in a low tone. Around the table
sat the <i>directorcillo</i>, two writers and some soldiers scribbling
papers. The <i>alferez</i> walked from one side to the other, looking
from time to time ferociously toward the door. Themistocles after the
battle of Salamis could not have shown more pride at the Olympic games.
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion yawned in one corner of the room, and disclosed
her black palate and her crooked teeth. Her cold and evil look was
fixed on the door of the jail, covered with indecent pictures. Her
husband, made amiable by the victory, had yielded to her request to be
allowed to witness the interrogation and, perhaps, the tortures which
were to follow. The hyena smelled the dead body, she licked her chops
and was wearied at the delay in the punishment.</p>
<p>The <i>gobernadorcillo&rsquo;s</i> chair, that large chair under the
portrait of His Majesty, was empty and seemed destined for some other
person.</p>
<p>At nearly nine o&rsquo;clock, the curate, pale and with eyebrows
knit, arrived.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t made any
one wait!&rdquo; said the <i>alferez</i> sarcastically to the friar.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I would have preferred not to be
present,&rdquo; replied Father Salv&iacute;, in a low voice, without
taking notice of the bitter tone.... &ldquo;I am very
nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As no one came, I decided that, in
order not to leave the chair empty, your presence.... You already know
that the prisoners are to leave town this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Young Ibarra and the <i>teniente
mayor?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> pointed toward the jail.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Eight are in there,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Bruno died last night at midnight, but his declaration has
been obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate saluted Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, who responded with a
yawn and an &ldquo;aah!&rdquo; The friar took the big chair under the
picture of His Majesty.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We can begin,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bring out the two who are in the
stocks!&rdquo; ordered the <i>alferez</i> in his most terrifying voice.
And turning to the curate, he added, changing his tone:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They are fastened in the stocks
with two holes vacant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who are interested in instruments of torture, we will say
that the stocks is one of the most innocent. The holes in which are
fastened the legs of the prisoner are a little more or less than a palm
apart. Leaving two holes vacant, and putting the prisoner&rsquo;s legs
in the holes on either side, would make the position strained, so that
the ankles would suffer peculiarly and the lower extremities be
stretched apart more than a yard. It does not kill instantly, as may
well be imagined.</p>
<p>The turnkey, followed by four soldiers, drew back the bolt and
opened the door. A nauseating odor, and the thick, damp air escaped
from the dense darkness of the prison and, at the same time, groans and
sighs were heard. A soldier lighted a match, but the flame was
extinguished in that foul, vitiated atmosphere, and they had to wait
till the air was renewed.</p>
<p>In the vague light of a candle, several human forms could be
discerned. They were men, some of whom locked their arms around their
knees and hid their heads between them, others were lying down, with
their mouths to the ground, some standing, and some leaning against the
wall. A blow and a creaking sound was heard, accompanied by oaths; the
stocks were being opened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion&rsquo;s body was bent forward, the muscles
of her neck were rigid, her eyes riveted to the half open door.</p>
<p>Between the soldiers came out Tarsilo, the brother of Bruno. He wore
handcuffs. His torn clothes disclosed well-developed muscles. His eyes
were fixed insolently on the <i>alferez&rsquo;s</i> wife.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is the one who defended
himself most bravely, and who ordered his companions to flee,&rdquo;
said the <i>alferez</i> to Father Salv&iacute;.</p>
<p>Behind came another miserable sight, a man crying and weeping like a
child. He was limping and his pantaloons were stained with blood.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mercy, se&ntilde;or, have mercy! I
will not enter the <i>cuartel</i> yard again,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is a crafty fellow,&rdquo; said
the <i>alferez</i>, speaking to the curate. &ldquo;He wanted to flee,
but had received a flesh wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked
the <i>alferez</i>, speaking to Tarsilo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tarsilo Alasigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What did Don Crisostomo promise
you for attacking the <i>cuartel</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Crisostomo has never
communicated with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it! You wanted to
surprise us for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are mistaken. You whipped our
father to death. We avenged him and nothing more. Look for your two
soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> looked at the sergeant, surprised.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They are at the bottom of that
precipice. We threw them there yesterday. There they will rot. Now kill
me! You will know nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence and general surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are not going to tell who were
your accomplices?&rdquo; said the <i>alferez</i> in a threatening
manner and brandishing a whip.</p>
<p>A scornful smile curled the lips of the culprit.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> conferred for some minutes with the curate in a
low voice. Then turning to the soldiers, he ordered:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take him to where the dead bodies
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a corner of the yard, upon an old wagon, were five <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>bodies close together and half covered by a
filthy piece of torn matting. A soldier on guard was pacing up and
down, and constantly spitting.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you recognize them?&rdquo;
asked the <i>alferez</i>, lifting the matting.</p>
<p>Tarsilo did not respond. He saw the dead body of Pedro, with two
others; one, his own brother, riddled with bayonet wounds, and the
other, Lucas, with the rope still around his neck. His look became
gloomy and a sigh seemed to escape from his breast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo; they
asked him.</p>
<p>Tarsilo remained silent.</p>
<p>There was a whistling sound and the whip came down across his back.
He trembled, and his muscles contracted. The lashes were repeated, but
Tarsilo continued impassive.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let them whip him till they cut
him to pieces or till he makes a declaration,&rdquo; cried the
<i>alferez</i>, exasperated.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak then!&rdquo; said the
<i>directorcillo</i> to him. &ldquo;They will surely kill
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led him back to the <i>sala</i> of the tribunal, where the
other prisoner was invoking God, grating his teeth and shaking on his
legs.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know this man?&rdquo; asked
Father Salv&iacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is the first time I have ever
seen him,&rdquo; replied Tarsilo, looking with a certain pity on the
other.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> gave him a cuff with his fist and kicked him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tie him to the bench!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without taking off the bloody handcuffs, he was fastened to the
wooden bench. The unhappy fellow looked about him as if in search of
some one, and his eyes fell on Do&ntilde;a Consolacion. He smiled
sardonically. Those present were surprised and followed his glance and
saw the se&ntilde;ora. She was biting her lips.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have never seen an uglier
woman,&rdquo; exclaimed Tarsilo amid the general silence. &ldquo;I
prefer to lie down on this bench as I am doing than to lie by her side,
like the <i>alferez</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Muse turned pale.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are going to whip me to death,
<i>alferez</i>,&rdquo; he continued, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>&ldquo;but to-night I
will be avenged by your woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Gag him!&rdquo; shouted the
<i>alferez</i>, furious and trembling with rage.</p>
<p>It seemed as though Tarsilo had wanted the gag, for when he had it
in his mouth, his eyes gleamed with a ray of satisfaction.</p>
<p>At a signal from the <i>alferez</i> a guard, armed with a whip,
began his cruel task. The whole body of Tarsilo shrank. A groan,
suppressed and prolonged, could be heard in spite of the rag which
stopped up his mouth. He lowered his head. His clothes were being
stained with blood.</p>
<p>Father Salv&iacute;, pale and with a wild look, rose to his feet
laboriously, made a sign with his hand and left the <i>sala</i> with
vacillating steps. In the street, he saw a girl, leaning her back
against the wall, rigid, immovable, listening attentively, looking into
space, her marble-like hands extended along the old wall. The sun was
shining full upon her. She was counting, it seemed without breathing,
the sharp blows and listening to that heart-rending groan. She was
Tarsilo&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the scene was continuing in the <i>sala</i>. The
unfortunate fellow, overcome with pain, had become silent and waited
for his punishers to tire. At last, the soldier breathless, let fall
his arm. The <i>alferez</i>, pale with wrath and astonishment, made a
signal for them to unloose him.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion then arose and whispered something into her
husband&rsquo;s ear. He nodded his head, signifying that he
understood.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To the well with him!&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>The Filipinos know what that means. In Tagalog they call it
<i>timbain</i>. We do not know who could have been the inventor of this
method of punishment, but we are of the opinion that he must have lived
long ago. In the middle of the tribunal yard there was a picturesque
stone-wall, roughly made out of cobble stones, around a well. A rustic
apparatus of bamboo in the form of a lever serves to draw out the vile,
dirty and bad smelling water. Broken dishes, refuse and all sorts of
filth collected there, since the well was a common receptacle for
everything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>that the people threw away or found useless. An
object which fell into the place, no matter how good it may have been,
was thereafter surely lost. However, the well was never closed up. At
times, prisoners were condemned to go down and make it deeper, not
because it was thought that the work would be useful in any way, but
because the work was so difficult. If a prisoner went down in the well
once, he invariably contracted a fever, from which he died.</p>
<p>Tarsilo contemplated all the preparations of the soldiers with a
firm look. He was very pale and his lips were trembling or murmuring a
prayer. The haughtiness of his desperation seemed to have disappeared,
or at least to have weakened. A number of times he bent his head, fixed
his eyes on the ground, resigned to his suffering.</p>
<p>They took him to one side of the stone wall. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion
followed smiling. The unfortunate wretch glanced enviously toward the
pile of dead bodies, and a sigh escaped from his breast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak now!&rdquo; said the
<i>directorcillo</i> again. &ldquo;They will certainly drown you. At
least, die without having suffered so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When you come out of this, you
will die,&rdquo; said a <i>cuaderillero</i>.</p>
<p>They took the gag out of his mouth and hung him by his feet. He had
to go down head first and remain under the water some time just like a
bucket, except that a man is left under the water a longer time.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> went to look for a watch that he might count the
minutes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tarsilo was hanging, his long hair waving in the
air and his eyes half closed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you are Christians, if you have
hearts,&rdquo; he begged, in a low voice, &ldquo;let me down rapidly
and make my head strike against the wall that I may die. God would
reward such a good deed.... Perhaps some day you will be in the same
straits as I am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> returned and with watch in hand witnessed the
descent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Slowly, slowly!&rdquo; cried
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion following the poor fellow with her eyes.
&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>The pole was being lowered slowly. Tarsilo rubbed against the
projecting stones and the dirty plants which grew in the crevices.
Then, the pole ceased to move. The <i>alferez</i> was counting the
seconds.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Up!&rdquo; he ordered dryly, at
the end of a half minute.</p>
<p>The silvery harmony of the drops of water falling back into the
well, announced the return of the unfortunate man to the light. As the
weight on the end of the lever was heavy, he came up quickly. The rough
pieces of stone and pebbles, torn loose from the walls, fell with
splashes to the bottom.</p>
<p>His face and hair full of filthy mud, his body wet and dripping, he
appeared again in the sight of the silent crowd. The wind made him
shiver with cold.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you want to make a
declaration?&rdquo; they asked him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take care of my sister!&rdquo; the
unhappy one murmured, looking at the <i>cuaderillero</i>, with
supplication.</p>
<p>The bamboo pole creaked again, and again the condemned man
disappeared. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion observed that the water remained
still. The <i>alferez</i> counted a minute.</p>
<p>When Tarsilo came up again, his face was livid and his features
contracted. He glanced at those standing around and kept open his
bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Will you make a
declaration?&rdquo; asked the <i>alferez</i> again, with vexation.</p>
<p>Tarsilo shook his head and again they let him down. His eyelids were
almost closed and his eyes were gazing at the white clouds floating in
the heavens. He bent his neck to keep sight of the light of day, but he
was soon submerged in the water. That filthy curtain closed from him
the sight of the world.</p>
<p>A minute passed. The Muse saw large bubbles of air come up to the
surface of the water.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is thirsty,&rdquo; said she,
laughing.</p>
<p>The water was again smooth.</p>
<p>This time a minute and a half had passed when the <i>alferez</i>
gave the signal.</p>
<p>Tarsilo&rsquo;s features were no longer contracted. The half opened
lids showed the white of his eyes. Muddy water, clotted with blood, ran
out of his mouth. The cool wind was blowing, but his body no longer
shivered. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>Those present, pale and terrified, looked at each other in silence.
The <i>alferez</i> made a signal for them to take him down from where
he was hanging, and stepped aside for a few moments. Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion a number of times applied the lighted end of her cigar to
the bare legs of Tarsilo, but his body did not quiver. It put out the
light.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He has asphyxiated himself,&rdquo;
murmured a <i>cuaderillero</i>. &ldquo;See how his tongue is turned, as
if he wanted to swallow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other prisoner, trembling and perspiring, contemplated the
scene. Like a madman he looked about him.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> ordered the <i>directorcillo</i> to question
him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
he groaned. &ldquo;I will tell you all that you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Good. Let us see! What is your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Andong, Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bernardo ... Leonardo ... Ricardo
... Educardo. Gerardo ... or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Andong, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
repeated the imbecile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Call it Bernardo or whatever you
please,&rdquo; said the <i>alferez</i>, decided not to bother more
about it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What family name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at him frightened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? What do
you add to the name Andong?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or! Andong
Medio-tonto (half-fool), Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those standing around could not resist a laugh. The <i>alferez</i>
himself stopped short.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cocoanut tree pruner,
Se&ntilde;or, and servant for my mother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who ordered you to attack the
<i>cuartel</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nobody, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that; nobody?
Don&rsquo;t you lie or we will put you in the well. Who ordered you to
do it? Speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth,
Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I ask you who ordered you to
revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What revolt,
Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That one last night, when you were
in the tribunal yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andong, blushing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who was to blame for
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My mother-in-law,
Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A laugh of surprise followed this reply. The <i>alferez</i> stopped
and looked sharply at the simple peasant, who believed that his words
had produced a good effect. More animated, he was about to continue
when the crack of a whip cut him short.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To the jail!&rdquo; ordered the
<i>alferez</i>. &ldquo;This afternoon, send him to the capital.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXVIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Accursed.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The news that the prisoners were going to depart
spread quickly through the town. At first, the news was heard with
terror; afterward, came tears and lamentations.</p>
<p>The members of the families of the prisoners were running about
madly. They would go from the convent to the <i>cuartel</i> from the
<i>cuartel</i> to the tribunal, and not finding consolation anywhere,
they filled the air with cries and moans. The curate had shut himself
up because he was ill. The <i>alferez</i> had increased his guards, who
received the supplicants with the butts of their guns. The
<i>gobernadorcillo</i>, a useless being, anyway, seemed more stupid and
useless than ever.</p>
<p>The sun was burning hot, but none of the unhappy women who were
gathered in front of the <i>cuartel</i> thought of that. Doray, the gay
and happy wife of Don Filipo, wandered about, with her tender little
child in her arms. Both were crying.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Get out of the sun,&rdquo; they
said to her. &ldquo;Your son will catch a fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the use of his living if
he has no father to educate him?&rdquo; replied the dispirited
woman.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your husband is innocent. Perhaps
he will return.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, when we are in our
graves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Capitana Tinay wept and cried for her son, Antonio. The courageous
Capitana Maria gazed toward the small grate, behind which were her
twins, her only sons.</p>
<p>There, too, was the mother-in-law of the cocoanut tree pruner. She
was not crying; she was walking to and fro, gesticulating, with shirt
sleeves rolled up, and haranguing the public.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you ever seen anything equal
to it?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;They arrest my Andong, wound him, put
him in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>stocks, and take him to the capital, all because
he happened to be in the <i>cuartel</i> yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But few people had any sympathy for the Mussulman mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Crisostomo is to blame for all
of this,&rdquo; sighed a woman.</p>
<p>The school teacher also was wandering about in the crowd. &Ntilde;or
Juan was no longer rubbing his hands, nor was he carrying his yard
stick and plumb line. He had heard the bad news and, faithful to his
custom of seeing the future as a thing that had already happened, he
was dressed in mourning, mourning for the death of Ibarra.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, an uncovered cart, drawn by
two oxen, stopped in front of the tribunal.</p>
<p>The cart was surrounded by the crowd. They wanted to destroy it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; said
Capitana Maria. &ldquo;Do you want them to walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark stopped the relatives of the prisoners. Twenty soldiers
came out and surrounded the cart. Then came the prisoners.</p>
<p>The first was Don Filipo; he was tied. He greeted his wife with a
smile. Doray broke into a bitter lamentation and two soldiers had to
work hard to keep her from embracing her husband. Antonio, the son of
Captain Tinay, next appeared, crying like a child&mdash;a fact which
made the family cry all the more. The imbecile, Andong, broke out in a
wail when he saw his mother-in-law, the cause of his misfortune.
Albino, the former seminary student, came out with his hands tied, as
did also the twin sons of Capitana Maria. These three youths were
serious and grave. The last who came was Ibarra. The young man was
pale. He looked about for the face of Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is the one who is to
blame!&rdquo; cried many voices. &ldquo;He is to blame and he will go
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My son-in-law has done nothing and
he is handcuffed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra turned to the guards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tie me, and tie me well, elbow to
elbow,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We have no orders.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tie me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldiers obeyed.</p>
<p>The <i>alferez</i> appeared on horse-back, armed to the teeth. Ten
or fifteen more soldiers followed him.</p>
<p>Each of the prisoners had there in the crowd his family praying for
him, weeping for him, and calling him by the most affectionate names.
Ibarra was the only exception. Even &Ntilde;or Juan himself and the
school-teacher had disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What have you done to my husband
and my son?&rdquo; said Doray to Ibarra, crying. &ldquo;See my poor
boy! You have deprived him of a father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grief of the people was changed to wrath against the young man,
accused of having provoked the riot. The <i>alferez</i> gave orders to
depart.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are a coward!&rdquo; cried the
mother-in-law of Andong to Ibarra. &ldquo;While the others were
fighting for you, you were hiding. Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Curses upon you!&rdquo; shouted an
old man following him. &ldquo;Cursed be the gold hoarded up by your
family to disturb our peace! Curse him! Curse him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May they hang you, heretic!&rdquo;
cried one of Albino&rsquo;s relatives. And unable to restrain himself,
he picked up a stone and threw it at Ibarra.</p>
<p>The example was quickly imitated, and a shower of dust and stones
fell on the unfortunate youth.</p>
<p>Ibarra suffered it all, impassive, without wrath, without a
complaint&mdash;the unjust vengeance of suffering hearts. This was the
leave-taking, the &ldquo;adios&rdquo; tendered to him by his town, the
center of all his affections. He bowed his head. Perhaps he was
thinking of another man, whipped through the streets of Manila, of an
old woman falling dead at the sight of the head of her son. Perhaps the
history of Elias was passing before his eyes.</p>
<p>The cort&eacute;ge moved slowly on and away.</p>
<p>Of the persons who appeared in a few opened windows, those who
showed the most compassion for the unfortunate young man were the
indifferent and the curious. All his friends had hidden themselves;
yes, even Captain Basilio, who forbade his daughter Sinang to weep.</p>
<p>Ibarra saw the smouldering ruins of his house, of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>house of his fathers where he had been born,
where he had lived the sweetest days of his infancy and childhood.
Tears, for a long time suppressed, burst from his eyes. He bowed his
head and wept, wept without the consolation of being able to hide his
weeping, tied as he was by the elbows. Nor did that grief awaken
compassion in anybody. Now he had neither fatherland, home, love,
friends or future.</p>
<p>From a height a man contemplated the funeral-like caravan. He was
old, pale, thin, wrapped in a woollen blanket and was leaning with
fatigue on a cane. It was old Tasio, who as soon as he heard of what
had happened wanted to leave his bed and attend, but his strength would
not permit it. The old man followed with his eyes the cart until it
disappeared in the distance. He stood for some time, pensive and his
head bowed down; then he arose, and laboriously started on the road to
his house, resting at every step.</p>
<p>The following day, shepherds found him dead on the very threshold of
his solitary retreat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXIX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Maria Clara is Married.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Captain Tiago was very happy. During all this terrible
time nobody had busied himself with him. They had not arrested him, nor
had they submitted him to excommunications, court trials, electrical
machines, continual hot foot baths in subterranean places, or to any of
the other punishments which are well known to certain people who call
themselves civilized. He had returned to his Manila house. Those who
had been the Captain&rsquo;s friends&mdash;for he had renounced all his
Filipino friends from the moment that they were suspected by the
Government&mdash;had also returned to their homes after some days of
vacation spent in the Government buildings. The Governor General had
himself ordered these people to leave their possessions, for he had not
thought it fitting that they should remain in them during the great
danger.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago was overflowing with gratitude, but he did not know
exactly to whom he was indebted for such signal favors. Aunt Isabel
attributed the miracle to the Virgin of Antipolo, to the Virgin of the
Rosary, or at least to the Virgin of Carmen. The least that she would
concede was that it was due to Our Lady of Corea. According to the
Aunt, the miracle was certainly due to one of these Virgins. Captain
Tiago did not deny that it was a miracle, but he added:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not believe, Isabel, that the
Virgin of Antipolo could have done it alone. My friends have aided in
it; my future son-in-law, Se&ntilde;or Linares has, as you know, joked
with Se&ntilde;or Antonio Canovas himself, whose portrait we saw in
&lsquo;Illustracion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the good man could not suppress a smile every time that he heard
any important news about the event. And there was good reason for it.
It was whispered about that Ibarra was going to be hanged; that, even
if many proofs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>had been lacking, at last one had appeared which
could confirm the accusation; and that skilled workmen had declared
that, as a matter of fact, the work for the school-house could pass for
a fort or a fortification. Even if defective in some parts, that was as
much as could be expected from ignorant Indians. These rumors quieted
the Captain and made him smile.</p>
<p>Just as the Captain and his cousin, Aunt Isabel, were of different
opinions about the miracle, so, too, the other friends of the family
were divided into different parties&mdash;those who followed the
miracle monger, and those who followed the Government. The latter
party, however, was quite insignificant. The miracle mongers were
sub-divided into other factions: the Sacristan Mayor of Binondo, the
woman who sold the wax candles, and the chief of one of the
brotherhoods, all saw the hand of God in the miracle, moved by the
Virgin of the Rosary. The Chinese candle maker, who provided the
Captain whenever he went on a pilgrimage to Antipolo, was saying as he
sat fanning himself and wiggling his foot:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What for you b&rsquo;long foolish?
Thisee belong Mergin Antipolo. She can do muchy more: others, no can
do. No b&rsquo;long plopper say pidgin b&rsquo;long other
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tiago held the Chinaman in great estimation and made him
pass for a prophet and doctor. Examining the hand of his deceased wife
in the sixth month of her pregnancy, he had prophesied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If thisee one no b&rsquo;long man,
and no go dead side, will b&rsquo;long bery good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was that Maria Clara came to this earth and fulfilled the
Chinaman&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago, being a prudent and timid person, could not decide
the question of the miracle as easily as the Trojan Paris. He could not
give preference to one of the Virgins for fear of offending some other
of them, a thing which might bring about grave results.
&ldquo;Prudence,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Be prudent! Let us
not lose all now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in the midst of these doubts when the party in favor of the
Government, or the Governmental party, arrived, viz., Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, Don Tiburcio, and <span class="corr" id="xd21e7320" title=
"Source: Linars">Linares</span>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250"
href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina did all the talking for the three men and for
herself also. She mentioned the visits which Linares had made to the
Governor General, and repeatedly brought out the benefits derived from
having a relative of <i>categor&iacute;a</i>.</p>
<p>For some days past, she had been trying to be Andalusian by
suppressing the <i>d</i> in all words and in changing the <i>s</i> to
<i>z</i>. No one could get the idea out of her head; she would prefer
to lose her front curls first.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in speaking
of Ibarra. &ldquo;That fellow merits very well all that he is going to
get. I told you so when I saw him for the first time. I told you he was
a <i>filibustero</i>. What did the General tell you, cousin? What did
he say? What news did you give him about Ibarra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that the cousin hesitated in his reply, she went on,
directing her words to Captain Tiago.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Believe me, if they convict him,
as is to be hoped, it will be through my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,
Se&ntilde;ora!&rdquo; protested Linares.</p>
<p>But she did not give him any time.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, what a diplomat you have
turned out to be! But we all know that you are the adviser of the
Governor General, that he could not live without you. Ah! What a
pleasure to see you, Clarita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara seemed paler than ever, although she was now quite
recovered from her illness. Sadly smiling, she approached and greeted
Do&ntilde;a Victorina with a formal kiss.</p>
<p>After the customary words had been exchanged, Do&ntilde;a went on
with her false Andalusian.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We came to visit you. You have
been saved by the efforts of your friends,&rdquo;&mdash;looking
significantly at Linares.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God has protected my
father,&rdquo; said the girl, in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Clarita, but the time for
miracles has passed long ago. As we Spaniards say: &lsquo;Have no trust
in the Virgin and save yourself by running.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The&mdash;th&mdash;the
ot&mdash;ot&mdash;other way,&rdquo; said the doctor, correcting her
proverbial quotation.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago, who had not yet found opportunity to say a word,
ventured to ask her, giving much attention <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>to
her reply: &ldquo;So you, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, believe that the
Virgin...?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is precisely what we came
for, to speak to you about <i>the</i> Virgin,&rdquo; replied she,
indicating Maria Clara. &ldquo;We have a matter to talk
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden understood that she ought to retire. She sought an excuse
and went away, supporting herself on the furniture as she walked
along.</p>
<p>What was said in the conference which followed was so low and mean
that we prefer to omit it. It is sufficient for us to say that when
they took their leave all were happy, and that Captain Tiago afterward
said to his cousin:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Isabel, send word to the
restaurant that we are going to give a <i>fiesta</i> to-morrow. You get
Maria ready to be married in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel looked at him, surprised.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will see! When Se&ntilde;or
Linares is our son-in-law all the palaces will be open to us. They will
be envying us; they will all die with envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus it was that at eight o&rsquo;clock on the following
evening, Captain Tiago&rsquo;s house was again full of guests, only
that this time the men whom he had invited were either Spaniards or
Chinamen, while the fair sex was represented by Spaniards born in the
Peninsula or in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The larger part of our acquaintances was there: Father Sibyla,
Father Salv&iacute; and several other Franciscans and Dominicans, the
old lieutenant of the Civil Guard, Se&ntilde;or Guevara, more
melancholy than ever; the <i>alferez</i>, who related his battle for
the thousandth time, feeling himself head and shoulders above everybody
and a veritable Don Juan de Austria, now a lieutenant with the rank of
commander; De Espada&ntilde;a, who looked at the former with respect
and fear and avoided his glance; and the indignant Do&ntilde;a
Victorina. Linares was not yet present, for, being a very important
personage, it was fitting that he should arrive later than the
others.</p>
<p>Maria Clara, the subject of all the gossip, was the center of a
group of women. She had greeted and received them ceremoniously, but
did not throw off her air of sadness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Psh!&rdquo; said one of the girls.
&ldquo;A little stuck-up!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A cute little thing,&rdquo;
replied another, &ldquo;but he might have selected some one of a more
intelligent appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the money; he&rsquo;s a
good-looking fellow and sells himself for a good price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another part of the room they were talking like this:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Marry, when her former betrothed
is about to be hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I call that prudence; to have one
on hand as a substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly the young maiden heard these remarks as she sat in a chair
near by, arranging a tray of flowers, for her hand was seen to tremble,
she turned pale and bit her lips a number of times.</p>
<p>The conversation among the men was in a loud tone. Naturally, they
were conversant with the recent happenings. All were talking, even Don
Tiburcio, with the exception of Father Sibyla, who maintained a
disdainful silence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have heard that Your Reverence
leaves the town, Father Salv&iacute;?&rdquo; asked the newly made
lieutenant, now made more amiable by the star on his sleeve.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have nothing more to do now in
San Diego. I am permanently settled in Manila now ... and
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I also leave the town,&rdquo;
replied the former <i>alferez</i>, straightening up. &ldquo;The
Government needs me to take command of a flying column to clear the
provinces of <i>filibusteros</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friar Salv&iacute; looked him over from head to foot, and turned his
back to him completely.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it yet known for a certainty
what is to become of the leader of the revolutionists?&rdquo; asked a
Government employee.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you referring to Crisostomo
Ibarra?&rdquo; asked another. &ldquo;What is most probable and most
just is that he be hanged, as those were in &rsquo;72.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He will be exiled,&rdquo; said the
old lieutenant, dryly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Exiled! Nothing more than exiled!
But it will be a perpetual exile!&rdquo; exclaimed several at the same
time.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If that young fellow,&rdquo;
Lieutenant Guevara went on to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>say in a loud voice,
&ldquo;had been more cautious; if he had trusted certain people less
with whom he had correspondence; and if the officers had not made a
subtle interpretation of what was written&mdash;if it had not been for
all of this, that young man would surely have gone free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement by the old lieutenant and the tone of his voice
produced a great surprise in the room. Those who heard it did not know
what to say. Father Salv&iacute; looked in another direction, perhaps
so as not to meet the dark look which the old man directed toward him.
Maria Clara dropped her flowers and sat motionless. Father Sibyla, the
one who knew how to keep silent, appeared to be the only one who knew
how to ask questions.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you referring to the letters,
Se&ntilde;or Guevara?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am telling what the
defendant&rsquo;s attorney told me. He has taken up the case with zeal
and interest. Aside from some ambiguous lines which this young man
wrote to a young woman before departing for Europe, they have found no
proof to sustain the accusation. In these few lines, the officers saw a
plan and threat against the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what about the declaration
made by the bandit before he died?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That statement has proved of no
account, since, according to the bandit himself, the conspirators never
had communicated with the young man, but only with one, Lucas, who was
Ibarra&rsquo;s enemy, as they have been able to prove, and who
committed suicide, perhaps from remorse. It has been proved that the
papers found in the possession of the dead man were forged, since the
handwriting was like that of Ibarra seven years ago, but not like that
of to-day&mdash;a fact which shows that it was copied from the letter
used as evidence against him. Besides, his attorney says that if Ibarra
had not admitted the genuineness of the letter, he would have been able
to do much for him; but, at the sight of it, the young man turned pale,
lost heart and acknowledged that he had written it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you say,&rdquo; asked a
Franciscan, &ldquo;that the letter was directed to a young woman? How
did it get into the hands of the officers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant did not reply. He looked for a moment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>at
Friar Salv&iacute; and then walked off, twisting nervously the end of
his grey beard. In the meantime, others were commenting something like
this:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There you see the hand of
God!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Even the women hate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He had his house burned, thinking
that he could thus save himself. But he did not reckon with his
host&mdash;that is, with his <i>querida</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"n254src" href="#n254" name="n254src">1</a> with his
<i>babai</i>,&rdquo;<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n254">1</a> added
another, smiling. &ldquo;That is God&rsquo;s work. Santiago protects
Spain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old army officer stopped and approached Maria Clara. She was
listening to the conversation, immovable in her seat. The flowers were
at her feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are a very prudent young
woman,&rdquo; said the old lieutenant to her in a low voice. &ldquo;You
have done well to hand over the letter.... In this way you will assure
yourself of a peaceful future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With dull eyes, and biting her lips, she looked at him as he walked
away. Luckily, Aunt Isabel passed her at this moment. Maria Clara
summoned enough strength to catch hold of her aunt&rsquo;s dress.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the matter with
you?&rdquo; asked the latter, frightened, as she saw the young
woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take me to my room!&rdquo; she
begged, clinging to the arm of the old woman in order to raise herself
to her feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you sick, my child? You seem
to have lost all your strength. What is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A little sick to my stomach ...
the crowd in the <i>sala</i> ... so much light ... I need to rest. Tell
father that I am going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are cold! Do you want some
tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara shook her head negatively. She closed the door of her
room and locked it, and, her strength failing her, she fell to the
floor, at the feet of an image, weeping and sobbing:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, mother, my
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moonlight was shining through the open window and door which led
out upon the <i>azotea</i>.</p>
<p>The orchestra continued playing gay waltzes. The laughter and the
hum of conversation could be heard in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>her bedroom. A number
of times her family, Aunt Isabel, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, and even
Linares, knocked at her door, but Maria Clara did not move. There was a
rattle in her throat.</p>
<p>Hours passed. The pleasures of the table ended, and dancing
followed. Her little candle burned out, but the maiden lay quietly on
the floor, the rays of moonlight shining upon her at the foot of an
image of the Mother of Jesus.</p>
<p>Gradually the noises in the house died away, the lights were put
out, and Aunt Isabel again knocked at the door of her room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us leave her; she is
sleeping,&rdquo; said her aunt. &ldquo;At her age, with nothing to
trouble her, she sleeps like a corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all was again silent, Maria arose slowly and glanced around
her. She saw the <i>azotea</i> and the small climbing plants bathed in
the melancholy light of the moon.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A peaceful future! Sleeping like a
corpse!&rdquo; she murmured in a low voice, and turned toward the
<i>azotea</i>.</p>
<p>The city was quiet. Only the noise of an occasional carriage passing
over the wooden bridge could be heard in the stillness of the night,
while the tranquil waters of the river were reflecting the
moonlight.</p>
<p>The maiden raised her eyes to the pure, sapphire-colored sky. Slowly
she took off her rings, her hair-combs, her earrings, and her
breast-pin, and placing them upon the balustrade of the <i>azotea</i>
she looked out toward the river.</p>
<p>A <i>banca</i>, loaded with rice grass, stopped at the foot of the
landing on the bank of the river at the rear of the house. One of the
two men who were propelling the boat went up the stone steps, leaped
over the wall, and a few seconds afterward, steps were heard coming up
the <i>azotea</i>.</p>
<p>Maria Clara saw him stop on discovering her, but it was for only a
moment. The man advanced slowly and at about three steps from the
maiden, stopped again. Maria Clara stepped back.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Crisostomo!&rdquo; she gasped,
full of terror.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, I am Crisostomo!&rdquo;
replied the young man, in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href=
"#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>grave voice. &ldquo;An enemy, a
man who has good reason to hate me, Elias, has helped me out of the
prison into which my friends had thrown me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence followed these words. Maria Clara bowed her head and allowed
both her hands to drop at her side.</p>
<p>Ibarra continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Beside the dead body of my mother,
I swore to make you happy, whatever might be my destiny. You can break
your oath; she was not your mother. But I, who am her son, I hold her
memory sacred, and, running great risk, I have come here to fulfill my
oath. Fortune permits me to speak with you personally. Maria, we shall
not see each other again. You are young and perhaps some day your
conscience may accuse you.... I come to tell you, before leaving, that
I forgive you. Now, may you be happy, and good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra tried to leave, but the maiden stopped him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Crisostomo!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;God has sent you to save me from desperation.... Hear me and
judge me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra wished to withdraw gently from her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have not come,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to call you to account.... I have come to give you
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I do not want the peace which you
give me. I will give myself peace. You despise me, and your contempt
will make my life bitter till death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra saw the poor girl&rsquo;s desperation, and asked her what she
desired.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That you may believe that I have
always loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crisostomo smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! You doubt me, you doubt the
friend of your infancy, who has never hidden a single thought from
you,&rdquo; exclaimed she in grief. &ldquo;I understand you. When you
know my history, the history which they revealed to me during my
illness, you will pity me and you will no longer answer my grief with
that bitter smile. Why did you not let me die in the hands of my
ignorant doctor? You and I would have been happier then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara rested a moment and then continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have doubted me; you have
wished my mother to pardon me. During one of those nights of suffering,
a man revealed to me the name of my true father, and forbade
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>me to love you ... unless my true father should
pardon you for the offense you committed against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra recoiled and looked in terror at the maiden.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;This man told me that he could not permit our marriage, since
his conscience would not allow it, and he would find himself compelled
to publish the truth at the risk of causing a great scandal, because my
father is ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she whispered a name in the young man&rsquo;s ear in a scarcely
audible voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What was I to do? Ought I to
sacrifice to my love the memory of my mother, the honor of the man who
innocently supposes himself my father, and the good name of my real
father? Could I do that without you despising me for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the proof? Have you proof? You
need proof!&rdquo; exclaimed Crisostomo, deeply agitated.</p>
<p>The maiden drew two letters from her bosom.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Two of my mother&rsquo;s letters:
two letters written in remorse before I was born. Take them, read them
and you will see how she cursed me and desired my death, which my
father in vain tried to cause by drugs. These letters were forgotten in
the house where he lived; a man found them and kept them. They would
only give them to me in exchange for your letter ... to make certain,
as they said, that I would not marry you without the consent of my
father. From the time that I began to carry them in my bosom instead of
your letter, my heart was chilled. I sacrificed you, I sacrificed my
love.... What would not a person do for a dead mother and two living
fathers? Did I suspect the use to which they were going to put your
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was prostrated. Maria Clara went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What was there left for me? Could
I tell you who was my father? Could I ask you to seek the pardon of him
who had so much desired my death, and who made your father suffer?
There was nothing left for me but to keep the secret to myself, and to
die suffering.... Now, my friend, you know the sad history of your poor
Maria. Will you still have that contemptuous smile for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria, you are a saint.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am happy now that you believe
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;However,&rdquo; added the young
man, changing his tone. &ldquo;I have heard that you are about to
marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sobbed the maiden.
&ldquo;My father asked this sacrifice of me. He has fed me and loved
me, and it was not his duty. I pay him this debt of gratitude which I
owe him by assuring him peace through this new relative, but
...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall not forget the oaths of
fidelity which I made to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you think of doing?&rdquo;
asked Ibarra, trying to read her eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The future is obscure and Destiny
is hidden in darkness. I do not know what I am to do; but I know that I
can love only once, and that without love I never will belong to any
one. And you, what is to become of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am nothing but a fugitive.... I
am fleeing. In a very short time, they will discover my escape,
Maria....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara clasped her arms about her lover&rsquo;s neck, kissed
his lips repeatedly, hugged him, and then, abruptly breaking away from
him, said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Flee! flee!
<i>Adios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at her, his eyes sparkling, but she motioned and he
went away, staggering like a drunken man. Again he leaped over the wall
and entered the <i>banca</i>. Maria Clara, leaning on the door casing,
watched him depart.</p>
<p>Elias took off his hat and bowed profoundly. <span class=

<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen, Se&ntilde;or, to my
plan,&rdquo; said Elias, as they directed the <i>banca</i> toward San
Miguel. &ldquo;I will for the present hide you in the house of my
friend in Mandaluyong. I will bring you all your money, which I have
saved and kept for you at the foot of the old <i>balit&icirc;</i> tree,
in the mysterious tomb of your grandfather. You shall leave the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To go to a strange land?&rdquo;
interrupted Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To live in peace the remaining
days of your life. You have friends in Spain, you are rich, you can get
yourself pardoned. By all means, a foreign land is better for you than
your own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e7656" title=
"Source: Crisosotomo">Crisostomo</span> did not reply. He meditated in
silence.</p>
<p>Just then they reached the Pasig and the <i>banca</i> was headed up
the stream. Over the Bridge of Spain a horse-man was galloping at high
speed, and a prolonged, sharp whistle was heard.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; replied Ibarra,
&ldquo;you owe your misfortunes to my family; you have saved my life
twice; I owe you not only gratitude, but also restitution of your
fortune. You advise me to go to a foreign land and live; then come with
me and we will live like brothers. Here, you, too, are
miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias sadly replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Impossible! It is true that I can
neither love nor be happy in my country; but I can suffer and die in
it, and perhaps die for it; that would be something. Let my
country&rsquo;s misfortune be my own misfortune. Since no noble thought
unites us, and since our hearts do not beat in harmony at the mention
of a single word, at least, let a common misery unite me to my fellow
countrymen; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>at least, let me weep with them over our grief;
let the same misery oppress all our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then why do you advise me to
leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because in other lands you can be
happy, and I cannot; because you are not made to suffer, and because
you would hate your country, if some day you should see the cause of
your misfortune: and to hate one&rsquo;s own country is the greatest
misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are unjust to me,&rdquo;
exclaimed Ibarra, with bitter reproach. &ldquo;You forget that I have
scarcely arrived here, and that I have already sought its
welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not be offended, Se&ntilde;or.
I am not reproaching you. Would to God that all might imitate you. But
I do not ask for the impossible and you should not be offended if I
tell you that your heart deceives you. You love your country because
your father has taught you to love it; you love it because you had in
it your love, your fortune, your youth; because it smiled on you, and
because it has not until now done you an injustice. You love your
country as we all love that which makes us happy. But, on that day when
you see yourself poor, ragged, hungry, persecuted, denounced and
betrayed by your very countrymen, on that day you will curse yourself,
your country and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your words grieve me,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, resentfully.</p>
<p>Elias bowed his head, meditated and replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I wish to set you right,
Se&ntilde;or, and to avoid a miserable future for you. You remember the
time when I was talking to you in this same <i>banca</i> and under the
light of the same moon. It was a month ago, a few days more or less.
Then you were happy. The plea of the unfortunates did not reach you.
You disdained their complaints because they were complaints from
criminals. You gave ear to their enemies, and, in spite of my reasons
and pleas, you put yourself on the side of their oppressors. On you
depended at that time whether I should turn criminal or allow my life
to be taken in fulfillment of my sacred pledge. God has not permitted
it, because the old chief of the bandits has been killed. A month has
passed and now you think differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right, Elias, but man is
influenced by changes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>in circumstances. Then I was
blind, and obstinate. What did I know? Now misfortune has torn the veil
from my eyes. The solitude and misery of my prison life have taught me;
now I see the horrible cancer which is sapping the life of society,
which hangs to its flesh and which requires violent extirpation. They
have opened my eyes; they have made me see the ulcer; they force me to
become a criminal. I will be a <i>filibustero</i>, but a true
<i>filibustero</i>. I will call upon all the unfortunates, on all who
have beating hearts within their breasts, on all who sent you to me....
No, no! I will not be criminal! It is never a crime to fight for
one&rsquo;s country! We for three centuries have given them our hand,
we have asked them for their love, we have anxiously wished to call
them our brothers. How have they replied? With insults and jests,
denying us even the quality of being human beings. There is no God,
there is no hope, there is no humanity. There is nothing but the right
of force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was excited. His whole body was trembling.</p>
<p>They passed by the Governor General&rsquo;s palace, and believed
they saw agitation and movement among the guards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have they discovered our
flight?&rdquo; murmured Elias. &ldquo;Lie down, Se&ntilde;or, so that I
can cover you up with the grass, for, when we cross over to the side of
the river near the powder house, the sentry may be surprised at seeing
two of us in this small <i>banca</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Elias had foreseen, the sentry stopped him and asked him where he
came from.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;From Manila, with grass for the
magistrates and curates,&rdquo; replied he, imitating the accent of one
from Pandakan.</p>
<p>A sergeant came out and was informed what was going on.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i>Sulung!</i>&rdquo; (Go on!)
said he. &ldquo;I warn you not to receive any one in your <i>banca</i>.
A prisoner has just escaped. If you capture him and hand him over to me
I will give you a good reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All right, Se&ntilde;or. What is
his description?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He wears a frock coat and speaks
Spanish. With that much, be on the watch!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>banca</i> went on. Elias turned his face and saw the shadow
of the sentry, still standing on the bank of the river.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We will lose several
minutes,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice. &ldquo;We will have to go up
the Beata river in order to carry out my pretense of being from
Pe&ntilde;a Francia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The town was sleeping in the light of the moon. Crisostomo arose to
admire the sepulchral peace of Nature. The river was narrow and its
banks formed a plain planted with rice.</p>
<p>Elias threw the load on the bank, picked up a piece of bamboo and
drew out from under the grass in the <i>banca</i> some empty sacks.
They went on rowing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are master of your own will,
Se&ntilde;or, and of your own future,&rdquo; said he to Crisostomo, who
kept silent. &ldquo;But if you will permit me to offer a suggestion, I
say to you: Look well at what you are going to do. You are about to
start a war, for you have money, talent, and you will quickly find aid,
for, unfortunately, many are discontented. Furthermore, in this fight,
which you are to begin, those who are going to suffer most are the
defenseless, the innocent. The same sentiments which a month ago
prompted me to come to you and ask for reforms, are those which now
move me to ask you to reflect. The country, Se&ntilde;or, is not
thinking of separating itself from the mother country. It asks only a
little liberty, a little justice, a little love. The discontented will
assist you, the criminals and the desperate, but the people will hold
aloof. You are mistaken if, seeing everything dark, you believe that
the country is desperate. The country suffers, yes, but it still hopes,
believe me, and will only rise in revolt when it has lost patience;
that is, when those who govern wish it&mdash;which is still far off. I
myself would not follow you. I shall never take recourse to these
extreme remedies while I see hope in men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then I will go without you!&rdquo;
replied Crisostomo, resolutely.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it your firm
decision?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, my firm and only decision: I
call to witness the memory of my father! I cannot allow them to deprive
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>me of peace and happiness with impunity, I who
have desired only my country&rsquo;s welfare, I who have respected all
and have suffered on account of a hypocritical religion, on account of
love for my country. How have they responded to me? By burying me in an
infamous prison and by prostituting my fianc&eacute;e. No, not to
avenge myself would be a crime. It would be encouraging them to commit
new injustices. No! it would be cowardice, it would be pusillanimity to
weep and groan while there is life and vigor, when to insult and
challenge are added scoffery and contemptuous ridicule! I will arouse
this ignorant people, I will make them see their misery&mdash;this
people who do not think of each other as brothers, who are mere wolves
devouring each other. I will tell them to rise against this oppression
and appeal to the eternal right of mankind to conquer their
liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Innocent people will
suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All the better! Can you lead me to
the mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Till you are safe!&rdquo; replied
Elias.</p>
<p>They again went up the Pasig. They spoke from time to time of
indifferent things.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Santa A&ntilde;a!&rdquo; murmured
Ibarra. &ldquo;Do you recognize that house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed by the country house of the Jesuits.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There I passed many happy and
joyful years!&rdquo; sighed Elias. &ldquo;In my time we used to come
here every month ... then I was like the others. I had fortune, family;
I was dreaming and planning a future for myself. In those days I used
to visit my sister in the neighboring convent. She made me a present of
a piece of her own handiwork. A girl friend used to accompany her, a
beautiful girl. All has passed like a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remained silent till they arrived at Malapad-na-bat&oacute;.
Those who have glided over the bosom of the Pasig on one of those
magical nights when the moon pours forth its melancholy poetry from the
pure blue of the sky, when the darkness hides the misery of men and
silence drowns the harsh accents of their voices, when Nature alone
speaks&mdash;those who have seen such nights on the Pasig will
understand the feelings which filled the hearts of both young men.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Malapad-na-bat&oacute; the carbineer was half asleep, and, seeing
that the <i>banca</i> was empty and offered no booty for him to seize,
according to the traditional custom of his corps and the use made of
that position, he readily let them pass on.</p>
<p>Nor did the Civil Guard at Pasig suspect anything, and they were not
molested.</p>
<p>It was just beginning to dawn when they reached the lake, calm and
smooth as a gigantic mirror. The moon was growing dim and the Orient
was rosy with the tints of morning. At a distance, a mass of grey could
be discerned advancing toward the <i>banca</i>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The <i>fal&uacute;a</i> (or
Government steamboat) is coming,&rdquo; murmured Elias. &ldquo;Lie down
and I will cover you with these sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outline of the vessel became more clear and perceptible.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She is putting in between the
beach and us,&rdquo; observed Elias uneasily.</p>
<p>And then he changed the course of the <i>banca</i> a little, rowing
toward Binangonan. To his great surprise he noticed that the
<i>fal&uacute;a</i> was also changing its course, while a voice cried
out to him.</p>
<p>Elias stopped and meditated. The shore of the lake was very far off,
and they would soon be in the range of the rifles on the
<i>fal&uacute;a</i>. He thought of returning to the Pasig. His
<i>banca</i> was swifter than the <i>fal&uacute;a</i>. But fate was
against him! Another boat was coming up the Pasig, and they could see
the helmets and shining bayonets of the Civil Guards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We are caught!&rdquo; he murmured,
turning pale.</p>
<p>He looked at his robust arms and taking the only course which
remained to him, he began to row with all his strength toward the
Island of Talim. In the meantime, the sun had risen.</p>
<p>The <i>banca</i> glided along rapidly. Elias saw some men standing
up on the <i>fal&uacute;a</i>, making signals to him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know how to manage a
<i>banca</i>?&rdquo; he asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes; why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because we are lost if I do not
leap into the water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>and make them lose the trail. They will
follow me. I swim and dive well.... I will take them away from you, and
then you can save yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; you remain and we will sell
our lives dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Useless! We have no arms, and with
those rifles they will kill us like birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a <i>chiss</i> was heard in the water like the fall
of a hot body, and was followed immediately by a report.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you see?&rdquo; said Elias,
putting his paddle in the <i>banca</i>. &ldquo;We will see each other
again at the tomb of your grandfather on <i>Nochebeuna</i> (Christmas
eve.) Save yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God has taken me through greater
dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias took off his <i>camisa</i>. A ball grazed his hands and the
report sounded out. Without being disturbed, he stretched out his hand
to Ibarra, who was still in the bottom of the boat. Then he arose and
leaped into the water, pushing away the small craft with his foot.</p>
<p>A number of cries were heard. Soon at some distance the head of the
young man appeared above the water as if to get breath, dropping out of
sight at the next instant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There, there he is!&rdquo; cried a
number of voices, and the balls from their rifles whistled again.</p>
<p>The <i>fal&uacute;a</i> and the other <i>banca</i> took up the
chase. A light track of foam marked his course, every moment leading
farther and farther away from Ibarra&rsquo;s <i>banca</i>, which
drifted along as if abandoned. Every time that the swimmer raised his
head to breathe the Civil Guards and the men on board the
<i>fal&uacute;a</i> discharged their guns at him.</p>
<p>The pursuit continued. Ibarra&rsquo;s little <i>banca</i> was
already far off. The swimmer was approaching the shore of the lake and
was now some fifty yards distant from it. The rowers were already
tired, but Elias was not, for his head often appeared above the water
and each time in a different direction so as to disconcert his
pursuers. No longer was there a light trail to betray the course of the
diver. For the last time they saw him near the shore, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>some
ten yards off, and they opened fire.... Then minutes and minutes
passed. Nothing appeared again on the tranquil surface of the lake.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterward one of the rowers pretended to have
discovered signs of blood in the water near the shore, but his
companions shook their heads in a manner which might mean either yes or
no. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=

<h2 class="main">Father D&aacute;maso Explains.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In vain the costly wedding gifts were heaped upon the
table. Neither the diamonds in their blue velvet caskets, nor the
embroidered <i>pi&ntilde;a</i>, nor the pieces of silk had any
attractions for Maria Clara. The maiden looked at the paper which gave
the account of Ibarra&rsquo;s death, drowned in the lake, but she
neither saw nor read it.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, she felt two hands over her eyes. They held her fast
while a joyous voice, Father D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s, said to her:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who am I? Who am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara jumped from her seat and looked at him with terror in
her eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You little goose, were you
frightened, eh? You were not expecting me? Well, I have come from the
provinces to attend your wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And coming up to her again with a smile of satisfaction, he
stretched out his hand to her. Maria Clara approached timidly and,
raising it to her lips, kissed it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the matter with you,
Maria?&rdquo; asked the Franciscan, losing his gay smile, and becoming
very uneasy. &ldquo;Your hand is cold, you are pale.... Are you ill, my
little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Father D&aacute;maso drew her up to him with a fondness of which
no one would have thought him capable. He grasped both the
maiden&rsquo;s hands and gave her a questioning look.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any confidence
in your godfather?&rdquo; he asked in a reproachful tone. &ldquo;Come,
sit down here and tell me your little troubles, just as you used to do
when you were a child, when you wanted wax-candles to make wax figures.
You surely know that I have always loved you.... I have never scolded
you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s voice ceased to be brusque; its
modulations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>were even caressing. Maria Clara began to
weep.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you weeping, my child? Why are
you weeping? Have you quarrelled with Linares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara covered her eyes with her hands.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No! It is not he now!&rdquo; cried
the maiden.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso looked at her full of surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you not want to entrust your
secrets to me? Have I not always managed to satisfy your smallest
caprices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman raised her eyes full of tears toward him. She looked
at him for some time, and then began to weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not cry so, my child, for your
tears pain me! Tell me your troubles. You will see how your godfather
loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara approached him slowly and fell on her knees at his feet.
Then raising her face, bathed in tears, she said to him in a low voice,
scarcely audible:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you still love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Child!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then ... protect my father, and
break off the marriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she related her last interview with Ibarra, omitting the
reference to her birth.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso could scarcely believe what he heard.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;While he lived,&rdquo; continued
the maiden, &ldquo;I intended to fight, to wait, to trust. I wanted to
live to hear him spoken of ... but now that they have killed him, now
there is no reason for my living and suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said this slowly, in a low voice, calmly and without a tear.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, you goose; isn&rsquo;t
Linares a thousand times better than....?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When he was living, I could have
married ... I was thinking of fleeing afterward ... my father wanted
nothing more than the relative. Now that he is dead, no other man will
call me his wife.... While he lived, I could have debased myself and
still had the consolation of knowing that he existed and perhaps was
thinking of me. Now that he is dead ... the convent or the
tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice had a firmness in its accent which took away Father
D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s joy and set him to thinking. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you love him so much as
that?&rdquo; he asked, stammering.</p>
<p>Maria Clara did not reply. Father D&aacute;maso bowed his head upon
his breast and remained silent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his
voice breaking. &ldquo;Forgive me for making you unhappy without
knowing it. I was thinking of your future; I wanted you to be happy.
How could I permit you to marry a native; how could I see you an
unhappy wife and a miserable mother? I could not get your love out of
your head, and I opposed it with all my strength. All that I have done
has been for you, for you alone. If you had become his wife, you would
have wept afterward on account of the condition of your husband,
exposed to all kinds of vengeance, without any means of defense. As a
mother, you would have wept over the fortune of your sons; if you
educated them, you would prepare a sad future for them, you would have
made them enemies of the Church and would have seen them hanged or
exiled; if you left them ignorant, you would have seen them oppressed
and degraded. I could not consent to it! This is why I sought as a
husband for you one who might make you the happy mother of sons born
not to obey but to command, not to suffer but to punish. I knew that
your friend was good from infancy. I liked him as I had liked his
father, but I hated them both when I saw that they were going to make
you unhappy, because I love you, I idolize you, I love you as my
daughter. I have nothing dearer than you. I have seen you grow. No hour
passes but I think of you; I dream of you; you are my only
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Father D&aacute;maso began to weep like a child.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, then, if you love me do not
make me eternally unhappy. He no longer lives; I want to be a
nun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man rested his head on his hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To be a nun, to be a nun!&rdquo;
he repeated. &ldquo;You do not know, my child, the life, the misery,
which is hidden behind the walls of the convent. You do not know it! I
prefer a thousand times to see you unhappy in the world than to see you
unhappy in the cloister. Here your complaints can be heard, there you
will have only the walls. You are beautiful, very beautiful, and you
were not born <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>for it, you were not born to be the bride of
Christ! Believe me, my child, time will blot it all out. Later you will
forget, you will love your husband ... Linares.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Either the convent or ...
death!&rdquo; repeated Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The convent, the convent or
death!&rdquo; exclaimed Father D&aacute;maso. &ldquo;Maria, I am
already old, I will not be able to watch you or your happiness much
longer.... Choose another course, seek another love, another young man,
whoever he may be, but not the convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The convent or death!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My God, my God!&rdquo; cried the
priest, covering his head with his hands. &ldquo;Thou punisheth me. So
be it! But watch over my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning to the young woman: &ldquo;You want to be a nun? You
shall be one. I do not want you to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara took his two hands, clasped them in her own and kissed
them as she knelt.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Godfather, my godfather!&rdquo;
she repeated.</p>
<p>Immediately, Father D&aacute;maso went out, sad, with drooping head
and sighing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God, O God! Thou existeth, for
Thou punisheth. But avenge Thyself on me and do not harm the innocent.
Save my child!&rdquo;</p>
